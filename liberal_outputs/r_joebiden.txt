History wil be kinder to Biden than our current society is. We took him for granted.
I’ll maintain until my dying day, but given the conditions he walked into Joe Biden had one of the best single terms of any president in the last I don’t know 50 years
Thank you President for being one of the most accomplished democratic presidents ever. It’s a shame he is the age he is, and I really hope whoever takes over from here runs on his policies. History will be kind to Joe. Idk if this is the right call but the polls seem to suggest it. Regardless, he was a great president.
If the Dems win in November, he will be forever remembered as the US's Cincinnatus.
He has been so wonderful. A true class act with real compassion for the American people.
History will be kind to Joe Biden.
This is sad. Here you have a guy who loves his country and has served it for most of his life. The only thing holding him back from a second term is the age he is and the fact that he knows what he wants to say, but he has a hard time getting it out correctly.
Then on the other hand you have a con man who has never loved anything more than he has loved himself.
Either way, this is a selfless act that I hope pays off in the end.
I wish we would have been smarter when he was younger and elected him. The first time he ran.
Thank you Biden for everything you’ve accomplished.


All too often I think of the scene where Leslie Knope tells the secret service to protect him at all cost, he's precious cargo! How very right she was.
Love ya President Biden
My favorite President, one and only
My favorite President too.
It's hard for me to put into words. I do think Biden could have run for 2024 ... and won. I have my own theories on how and why this all came down. Tonight is really bittersweet for me. His speech should be talking points for Harris in terms of the record she can run on.
I was really hopping he would, but I think he made the right decision at the perfect time to boost VP Harris. I wish him a very well deserved and enjoyable time with his family as much as his heart desires without having to worry about being the best President. He indeed gave his best to the country. I so wish to have the opportunity to meet him one day
Biden seems to rise to the occasion every time. I’m just not sure he could have run the race that’s required. I honestly was afraid that we’d kill him with this campaign. In any case, we owe him an eternal debt.
he seemed damn invigorated. maybe the shackles of campaigning wore him down. covid....the release of the prisoners. we'll never know. trump debate was horrendous. trump is, and will always be a gish galloping mish mash of lies & hyperbole.
i think there was fracturing within the democratic party that lead to joe biden bowing out--instead of a unified front behind joe biden, there were too many voices wanting a say.
as a positive however, joe biden left it all out there in his speech. his legacy is cemented now. i hope he has enough days left to see that indeed, this country is full of possibility & hope. and that the soul of our nation is healed and more vibrant than ever.
My FDR as a millennial
We love you Joe! You’re a good man.


Trump will claim that he had 90,000 people in the same arena... and they all wore red hats... and they cried when they saw him.
Ketchup on the walls the walls tonight!
The Mayor of Mesa, AZ (a lifelong Republican) was there and spoke. He’s voting blue.
Edited b/c Rx drugs….😂
There’s a new initiative called Republicans for Harris!!
Wowowowow!
This is insane.
Turn the lights off trump, the party is over
As long as everyone gets out to vote.
Fucking ride 😎
I did phone banking to verify attendance and answer questions. Had to let a lot of people down gently when they asked for more reservations for their friends and family. They were gone before i took to the phones.


Biden has far exceeded my expectations as a president. It's astonishing to have had the most substantive and effective president of my lifetime after the most shallow. It pains me that so many Americans can't seem to appreciate what this man has done but I'm hopeful because people are seeing the promise in Kamala Harris.
Enjoy retirement Joe. You've done this nation proud.
I always get Old Captain America vibes from Joe, and like the character, he deserves a rest from a good life of hard work for our country.
Similar to how Abraham Lincoln's greatness is amplified by him being preceded by and succeeded by 2 of America's worst presidents. Trumps awfulness is magnified by the decency of those who came before and after him.
A selfless act. This is what country over party means. 🥳
Exceeded my expectations after the Covid experience
I’ll never forget the dancing in the streets when Biden won! OMG we were so happy. I’m going to miss him so much. Kamala simply must win. We cannot give up President Biden for that nasty orange POS. We just can’t.
Such a great President and human being!!💙💙💙
Thank you, President Biden, for everything you have done for this country. You accomplished more in 3 1/2 years than I thought possible. You are my favorite all time President. I really mean it.



💙💙💙💙 - also he looks like old Captain America in this shot 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪💪💥💥

I love that I don’t have to check the news every hour.

Seriously, you don't announce you'll spend $45M per month until election day unless you *want* something.
must have been a big item. so many give it away for much cheaper.
The people he hired to handle his social media accounts need a fat raise!
Let’s all vote blue so they can keep their jobs
Nice! They can't just keep quiet about these ugly corporate / individual financial forces that are entering the fray to control the US Government.
Surprised he hasn't banned Biden yet.
The Streisand effect on that would be glorious
And I’m sick of Elon Musk and Kyle Rottenhouse infesting my state with their far-right nonsense. They need to go back to South Africa and impose heavy taxes on his fortunes.
Good for him! Joe Biden is standing up to Big money, we need a man like him in office four more years. Vote blue, vote Biden-Harris 2024! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🥶🥶💙💙💙🌀🌀🌀🎵🎶🎵🎶We love Dark Brandon! ❤️. #Stoptrump
His social media team isn’t half bad. That was beautiful.
I mean, Chump is threatening to subject Liz to a military tribunal for whatever the fuck invented bullshit he can think of if he wins….
Fuuuuck.... You know you screwed up when Dick Cheney calls you out like that.
He should invite Trump hunting...
Is W going to come out and say it? How much sway and respect do these two have amongst Republicans or independents these days? MAGA is a pretty strong response against some of their policies. In a rational universe, the numerous former Trump appointees who are against him would send the strongest message.
There are a ton of disenfranchised GOP that are going to continue being disenfranchised.
If you’re still MAGA at this point, despite everything, you’re in it for the long haul
Dubya already did in 2020. Came out and said he couldn't support the orange traitor because he was a threat to democracy.
He SHOULD come out and publicly saying now too.
Democrats: Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with a neoconservative.
Cheney: What about side by side with a friend?
Democrats: Just don’t shoot me in the face, OK?
Is this Cheney video new or was it just retweeted recently? I remember seeing it a while ago
this is from 2022
I guess things are really bad when you are happy to see Dick Cheney.


Hang in there Jimmy! We love you ❤️
 Former President Jimmy Carter told family that as he approaches his milestone 100th birthday this fall that he's holding on to vote in the presidential election.
“I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” Carter told his son Chip this week, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Carter, who turns 100 on Oct. 1, has been receiving hospice care for over a year. In 2015, the 39th president was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to his brain.
Carter voted in the Georgia primary in May, according to family.
“He’s not going to miss an election,” grandson Jason Carter said at the time. “It’s important to him. I mean, that’s the person he is.” 
Representatives from the Carter Center in Atlanta could not be immediately reached for comment.
In my head I kept thinking that he's just holding out to see what turn this country is going to take. This election is so fucking important to determine what kind of country this is going to be. He's been in hospice for a year and a half, there must be something he's still holding on to. This kind of confirms it for me.
A literal national treasure
He really is.
Dang, and his one vote is in a swing state- it could decide the whole election, like Florida in 2000! Hang in there, President Carter!
Love this guy…set the bar high for post presidency causes!
You can do it President Carter! We love you!
I took my grandfather to the polls and helped him fill out his ballot for the last election he was alive for. We had discussed the candidates and the ballot measures at length and he made his own decisions. He and I shared a love of democracy and politics and he waited for me to get home so I could take him to the polls. I was also the grandchild that helped him vote absentee during COVID. Those are memories I will always cherish.
Ofc we can and I feel like we will. Clearly there’s reason to be concerned but we have to her get our shit together and win
Doris Kearns Goodwin pointed out that Teddy Roosevelt was running for a nonconsecutive term, shot on the campaign trail and went on to lose.
We’re winning this, ESPECIALLY with JD Vance attached to the ticket.
The Blue Wave is incoming.
We MUST win this
Yes. The stakes could not be higher. It was bad in 2020; it's worse now.
JD Vance being chosen will help the Democrats. Vance is far too right wing and frankly too young. If something happens to trump, then Vance would be our president? Give me a break, he's 39 years old.
Of course. If Americans turn out and vote, Democrats win in a landslide.
It's only voter apathy that allows Republicans to win.
And win big!
It's because the MSM has nothing else to report on. Other than Biden being old, he hasn't been a contentious president. No new wars were started, no sleeping with staff members, no fraud. There were no scandals at all. With Trump, every day there was a new scandal. The MSM loved it because people were glued to their screens.
And now they want Trump back because they know it will increase their revenue. They are not reporting the news, now they're mandating it.
Everyone forgets the absolute non-stop list of scandals that team Trump had during his time in office. Literally, everyday was waking up looking at your phone and wanting to scream WTF...and by end of the day forgetting that story because a different story had hit a lunch and as you were leaving... watching the news nightly twitching as the thought "did he just say that fucking shit out loud!!"...like living in a constant state of DEFCON 3...only to start 2020 and see that rachetted up to DEFCON 2 for the year.
My mental health is so much better under Biden
Media has always been like this. Republicans get special treatment while Dems are held to impossible standards
Polls have become political propaganda. As has the mainstream media.
They don’t want us to vote. They saw the UK. They saw France. They saw 2022 and they saw every special election before and since.
Democrats are winning.
The only people complaining about Biden are bad faith actors trying to keep the vote home. Trump and MAGAism is their cash cow, after all.
Even good faith actors are inundated with misinformation, even by ostensibly trustworthy sources of information. The fact that there's already been a while primary process that picked Biden as the nominee is treated as irrelevant and not worth mentioning, tons of column inches are dedicated to the fiction that there's some organized way of replacing Biden, gossip about his health, gossip about him dropping out, etc. The media is failing Americans.
I'm especially disappointed in Jon Stewart for railing on him. Like, I get that Dump has been widely covered already, but the focus on Biden is misplaced and even entertaining a replacement at this point is sewing discord in the party when we are facing an election that demands we unify and defeat right wing fascism. Jon is not wrong. But he is not helping either.
That's the way it sounds with the media, the mainstream media that is.
NYT just ran an absolutely bonkers proposal from Carville that we have a “mini primary” of 8 people - he grudgingly invited Harris, what an asshole - and then have Bill Clinton and Barack Obama moderate debates with these 8 people and then let the delegates decide.
He and Axelrod are trying and failing to make themselves relevant again. Donna Brazile is the only one in this crowd who is sticking up for Biden.
This has been my stance since the debate. We got to watch as the "live fact checkers" watched Trump waltz through a forest of lies, while looking right at him as he cited after-birth abortions, events which never happened, and no fact checking at all.
So, just like the usual debate system, but with better advertising.
I just got home from this rally in Raleigh. We were pretty morose walking in, but as soon as he came out and started talking, it was like night and day from yesterday. Whatever the difference was, his team needs to figure it out quickly and make sure yesterday doesn't happen again.
An audience. He didn't know where to look, didn't feel comfortable the entire time, and clearly hadn't been allowed to rest, so he was fighting his stutter the whole time.
As I mentioned elsewhere - i think he spent too much of the day working the crowd and was exhausted by the time the debate started.
Being exhausted makes it so stutterers have a much harder time overcoming their stutter
I like how Biden takes accountability and can acknowledge when he messes up.
Anybody notice last night how he was saying that we need to keep doing better for Black communities, and Trump misread Biden’s humility as a bad thing and piled on blaming Biden for something else?
Trump may have talked more quickly, but he sounded like he was aided by amphetamines.
that's his secret, he's always on amphetamines
This is the energy that President Biden needs to bring every time. It’s the best way to show voters that he is capable to lead even if he’s a bit older.
Can't wait to vote for Biden!
Really wish he could've incorporated this into his closing statement last night, but he looks much better here. Good to know last night was likely a one-off.
He’s humble and I love that about him. Unlike somebody else..
Let’s go Joe. This is the right theme - take away the stigma. Acknowledge your weaknesses, and show how you and your administration will be DRAMATICALLY better for the United States and the world.



Joe Biden had a long and impressive political career, especially when it came to foreign affairs. He was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years, where he played a big role in shaping U.S. foreign policy and building international relationships.
Biden is known for being strong-willed and sometimes stubborn, but his best quality is his ability to compromise. He was great at negotiating and making deals with the opposition, which is key to how our democracy works.
The guy is full of integrity, he is a great politician, he is insanely accomplished, one of the few Vice Presidents who actually did something ( usually VPs are not as active due to limited power), but Biden was working ten hours every day and getting Democrats and some Republicans to support Obama ), the guy worked so hard and achieved so much, but people don`t give him the respect he deserves.
Forward to Biden’s presidency so far (only 3.5 years):
he’s undeniably the most productive and effective president by accomplishments in the last 40 years at least.
He was usually able to make a deal with the opposition, which is one of the pillars of our democracy.
That`s difficult, but a more “normal” accomplishment.
Biden was able to make deals with the most obstructionist opposition in modern US history ( if not ever, apart from the era around the civil war ),
And he didn`t just make any normal deals, he created the biggest and most extensive legislation packages in all of American history.
Roosevelt the previous record holder, managed to also do an insane amount of legislation but he had the full Democratic Party behind him and absolute support in Congress and the Senate. Biden did not and still managed to pull through, and that in a single term, Roosevelt had 4.
So Biden`s accomplishment is arguably more impressive.
Joe Biden will be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in American history.
And this is probably why Biden himself doesn`t mind as much as I do about how he got treated by everyone.
A Tragic Hero.
Also very sad that whoever wins in Nov will take much of the credit from the increases economic output and quality of life improvements in all of the bills he passed
His real legacy will be in 50 years from now when our grandkids or greatgrandkids are in university learning about him. It's time away from the moment & perspectives from people who have worked with him to come out to really get a grasp on him.
I wish we had a thousand Joe Bidens in the Florida political system.
Finally someone said it. Some of you might say Barack Obama, he’s a great inspiration, but he was never “progressive” enough. Joe Biden is in this sweet spot between progressive and moderate. He also got a lot of things done.
My hero
All I know is that he saved us from Trump and behaved honorably in the White House. I'll always love and respect him for that, regardless of his other accomplishments.
🇺🇸UNION🦅JOE🇺🇸 the GOAT POTUS.
Yes and it is not even close. Assuming Harris wins and his gambit pays off, the man will be a top ten president. If Trump wins a second term, I think how well Biden’s legacy is ultimately viewed will come down to what guardrails his administration was able to put in place before leaving office.
In the eyes of American history he took over right after maga idiots sacked the capitol and turned around and was able to pass so major legislation with a small majority.
I’m confident when I grow old we’ll look back fondly on the Biden presidency.
This was never seriously in doubt. What is in doubt is whether we love America as much as he does.
man, this is heavy. and goddamn true <3
"Don't do it, Vladimir."
"No way"
"Way"
'Wa'
I'll never forgive the press for what they did to him. Joe, you have been an incredible president.
I never once heard Trump say “my fellow Americans” like every other president has
Trump would post a long rambling post about how much the country sucks without him and that he's the only one who can fix it.
More like, "What have you done for me lately, America?"
Honest question. Do you think Trump has ever said that to his kids?
Maybe Ivanka, but not in a good way.
Nobody loves America mo- let me tell you- they say "President Trump isn't it true you love America the most" and I say some people say that, some very smart people, tears in their eyes. Crooked Biden, sleepy Joe, worst America lover, barely any love for flag or for American, border policy bad, bad border policy, anyone coming in, Hannibal Lector, they call it open border and they love it



I miss him already, this guy made America great again.
AND WERE GONNA KEEP IT GREAT
Damn straight we are! We’ve got to do Joe proud.
You said it right! Biden made America great again.
This little puppy will bite anyone you don't like
Considering that they only bit secret service members, and we know that the Secret Service deleted incriminating text messages on their devices to protect Trump from prosecution, I think those dogs might just have been really good judges of character.
It is amazing how productive our President Joe Biden is, yet he always makes time to visit with young children and to reach out especially to those who are suffering. That deep compassion is something we all cherish in Joe.
This guy is my hero
This man is an inspiration and deserves better.
Love Grandpa Joe.
Weird how Biden was able to secretly orchestrate multiple prosecutions of Trump, yet unable to stop the prosecution of his own son.
They think it’s an “op” to distract from other crimes and add legitimacy to the Trump conviction.
Especially since he has had the (fully legal) power all along to stop this prosecution by simply pardoning him. But he hasn't done that.
Funny how he didn’t attack the judge, jury, the prosecution, or the justice system.
This is a true leader right here.
Imagine if it was DJTJ, Trump would be screaming corruption and political prosecution
I don’t know how anyone can compare these two and push the red button.
Because this country is full of mouth breathing, knuckle dragging, self hating losers that only feel good when everyone else around them is doing worse then them
fox news will never share this with their audience
Or worse, they'll share a few out of context snippets from this quote. They'll report the quote as
All those parts are in the quote in that order. But the ellipses (the ...s) take out a lot.
So... he's not calling for the murder of the judge, prosecution, jury and witnesses? But Republicans have said that's what you're supposed to do.
He's just... accepting the law? I'm confused. Isn't the law supposed to be bad? Isn't everything supposed to be a witch hunt? Isn't he supposed to pardon anyone who is connected to him like the former guy did?
Also, it's amazing how Hunter's trial went through in record time. Wasn't dragged out for years with appeal after appeal. No demands to move venue. No demands to impeach the judge. No demands to move it to federal court.
Just a message of love and support. Sounds like a loving parent. And someone who respects the law. And who isn't abusing the power of his office.
Regardless, I'm not voting for Hunter Biden for president.



From the Time article:
"Germany honored U.S. President Joe Biden for his contribution to trans-Atlantic relations on Friday, ahead of his meetings with European allies on Russia’s war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East."
"

I am so so sad to lose such as amazing world leader. I know Kamala is ready and able, that was never in question. Nothing can ever fully replace his decades of hard earned relationship building. It is a loss to grieve while supporting the bright path forward Kamala creates in our international relations and in our domestic dignity.
(several edits toward both clarity and brevity)
Well Deserving, this man is a phenomenal president in terms of foreign and domestic policy.
He is the second President of the United States to receive this honour. In 1993, George H.W. Bush received this Order of Merit for his services to the cause of German unity.
Best POTUS of my lifetime. Thanks Joe!
I earned the Schützenschnur and the Abzeichen für Leistungen im Truppendienst in gold.
Biden and I are basically the same
Why were those honors bestowed upon you?
WELL DESERVED!
I love Joe and I do not care who knows it.
Well deserved, Joe. Phenomenal president and human being.
Speaking of deserved, what formal honor will Putin bestow upon Trump?



Joe is an eagles fan? Go birds?
I’m just proud to know he’s a NFL fan at all. I’ve seen a couple of old pics of him holding a football when Obama was in office but never saw anything beyond that.
GO BIRDS
He'll enjoy his weekend and then go back to work protecting our country and making our lives better until Kamala puts her hand on the Bible and gets sworn in as the president. And then he still won't be far from a phone to offer advice if it's requested. Our President!
Look how classy they are too. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden knew the long lenses would be out. They took the necessary precautions to prepare for surreptitious photoshoots by doning discrete cover-ups. I love these guys. Joe is a hero in my book. He saved us from the headlong economic downturn initiated by the former guy. He rescued us from the worst ravages of COVID that were set in motion through inaction and worse by the cold-hearted former presidency. Enjoy your time in the sun Joe and Jill. A nation is grateful for your service.
Go birds
I just know he has more surprises for the gop in the next couple of months. Glad to see him rest and get ready for more winning :D
Grab some R&R now and prepare to help with Kamala's sprint to the Presidency.
Nice! I can so relate to this.
Joe and Jill, enjoy!
I feel like the entire Democratic Party—except for David Axelrod (because of course he is) and a select few Dems—are rallying behind Biden.  The dude had ONE bad night, and the next day, he was reborn.  Don’t fret, we’ve got this.
It’s an insane proposition, because the $200M+ raised by Biden and Harris isn’t even legally transferable to another candidate, and the election infrastructure isn’t something that can just be spun up overnight.
Not only is it strategically stupid, it’s logistically impossible.
And btw, every other possible dem candidate polls worse vs trump than Biden, which republicans know very well.
Real Dems (not the bad faith trolls astroturfing the subject) need to stop wasting time and energy hoping for some non-existent magical unicorn of a candidate to swoop in to save us, and use that time and energy to make sure we win this election.
But meaningless hand-wringing and complaining is easy and putting in actually meaningful work is hard.
Strangely, Jamie Raskin claimed Biden may have slight chance of getting replaced, even after he acknowledged that Biden in Raleigh showed strong performance. However the way he worded it feels like the Raleigh speech soothed the naysayers and at most made people want to make sure the awful blunder won't happen again.
I think we should move on from the debate performance and continue to push our overall message real hard.
While the response to it has certainly been disheartening, we also have to remember the general public tends to lack any sort of object permanence when it comes to news stories like this so I hope this doesn't make you all discouraged.
Look, I am upset that this debate was terrible for the optics of Democratic Party. I am fine with people criticizing Joe Biden. What pisses me off is that people are losing sight of what we should really be focusing on: PLATFROM POLICY. But, no, let’s instead waste time to write the millionth AI-generated fuck-all hit-piece about dropping Biden.
I am of the mindset that dropping Biden will alienate a ton of voters. Older voters. Moderates. Dropping Biden in hopes of securing the youth vote and the undecided is a dumb gamble. The youth demographic, 18-25, historically has poor turn-out. The ‘undecided’ voters? How many of those people are just grifters who ultimately stay home or vote for write-in candidates like ‘Hugh Jass?’
Going further, does anyone actually think the casual voter even knows who other Democratic candidates are? For example, I guarantee most voters know fuck-all about Whitmer and Newsom. I hate to say it, but the average voter is politically illiterate. What they typically do recognize are names and parties. Biden at least has those two things going for him.
I am voting Biden and down-ballot democrat this election. I have been a Democratic voter since I turned 18 over 13 years ago. I define myself as a moderate democrat. If the party decides to drop Biden, I’m still going to vote democrat this election. But, in the future, if this party is going to panic at the slightest test of adversity, I am seriously going to consider how much faith I have in this party as I vote in future elections.
I agree completely that dropping Biden will alienate large swathes of the electorate while not even guaranteeing that they will replace their losses with new voters. Also, the fact that there’s not even a consensus on a “replacement” candidate guarantees that there will be bitter infighting through Election Day about whoever did take Biden’s place.
There’s no one else. If you’re concerned about Biden’s competency, remember what Trump will do if he wins and that Biden is literally doing the job at this very moment.
I strongly suspect this would be the case. Biden's debate performance in 2020 was disappointing as well, but he's just damn popular with voters. Switching candidates to get some better debate soundbites is still going to be the equivalent of sticking a branch between your bike wheel spokes at top speed.
It’s so dumb of a talking point right now.
Staying with Biden risks a loss, but a fight over who the nominee will be risks a landslide and not enough senators to stop some awful bills.
Staying with Biden builds strength and minimizes the chances of a loss.
He's beaten trump before, and we'll beat him again.


Lead Paragraphs:
A majority of Republicans support President Joe Biden's new Supreme Court reform plan, according to a poll that was published on Friday.
After the Court handed down several controversial rulings and with some justices on the Court being accused of unethical behavior, the Biden administration unveiled a three-part reform plan on July 29 that would check the powers of the Court. Biden, who recently ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, will be pushing to reform the Court before he leaves office in January "because this is critical to our democracy," he said in an Oval Office address last month.
The reform plan would create a constitutional amendment ensuring former presidents are not immune from crimes committed while in office, establish a single 18-year term limit for justices who currently are allowed to serve on the Court until retirement or death and establish a binding, enforceable code of conduct that would require justices to disclose gifts, not publicly participate in political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have a conflict of interest.
In a USA Today/Ipsos poll conducted from August 2 to 4, 70 percent of Republicans said they support establishing a binding code of conduct for the Court, 54 percent said they support enacting a constitutional amendment ensuring no person is above the law, including the president, and 51 percent support imposing term limits for justices.
Too bad Trump's party isn't Republican any more....
It is absolutely wild that only 54% of them supported that amendment.
If you tell them it’s a Joe Biden proposal that will drop to 2%. There’s no policy consistency - just supporting their team
Wow President Joe Biden and team are American Heroes for proposing this right here!!
I feel like this should be a topic of a campaign ad for Kamala. Biden and Harris are willing to have their actions in the White House legally scrutinized. Why would Donald be against these entirely sensible measures? Because he knows he’s a criminal, of course.
A Constitutional Amendment takes time to come to fruition. The right is making an appearance that they’re on the right side of history but after the election it will disappear. We wouldn’t have this problem if President Obama had been allowed to have his nominees pass.
Republicans or Republican Senators?
Buuut it takes one to filibuster and you need 60 votes to overcome it in the senate. (Killing the filibuster might be priority 1)
Join:
Says so much about Joe that he would do this. Whether right or wrong, he wouldn’t have stepped down if he didn’t think it was in the party’s best interests. Can you imagine Trump ever doing something like this under any circumstances?
This also shows Democrats are now proving they are not defined by one man. What’s the GOP’s excuse?
This is our event horizon.
Whatever it takes to get Kamala into the White House.
Whatever it takes to stop Project 2025.
Whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump once and for all.
Time to not fuck around ... Kamala Harris for President.
It has to be Harris. She’s been fully vetted, is qualified and pushing her aside would splinter the base.
I agree. She can help revive the Obama Coalition, and cutting her out would upset women and the black community. Can’t do that now.
Her VP pick is going to be crucial though. Gotta get that right.
Very few men would have the humility to do this. It draws a stark humility between himself and Trump. His stock will soar and now he needs to use that political capital and boost Kamala to get her over the finish line.
Joe was the perfect candidate for our nation in 2020. No one else has his depth of experience and knowledge partnered with genuine love and concern for our country. No one. We needed someone with his mature temperament and wisdom to make the best decisions. He's the real deal and we are so blessed to have him as POTUS.
He has done more than most people realize and I believe our nation will be forever grateful that he was at the helm during this time in our nation's history.
I hope Kamala is the nominee and next POTUS.
As an aging, disabled woman, I can see, feel, and hear there is an all out war on women and our rights. Project 2025 used Handmaids Tale as a blueprint. A Kamala Harris nomination for the democrats, will bring out a mass similar to the 2017 Pink Cat-eared hat wearing people of all genders who are ready for our first female president. We may be tired but Kamala as the nominee will be the oxygen we need right now.
I am completely behind Kamala Harris. This is unprecedented, but I have hope.



This would have been the best buddy movie ever, better than even Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan films.
This gets me every time: https://youtu.be/d3UCW_AV93M?si=z3FbYmgv7JjBru85
Someone who not only stood by my side through this amazing journey, but also devoted his whole life in service to this country. Aagghh, you got me😭😭
This is one of the most amazing moments in American history. Not because it is particularly relevant. But because it is beautiful. It is the President of the United States acknowledging a true public servant. Even Biden’s response to that award shows how much he reveres this country and her traditions. The man is a patriot and seeing him get this acknowledgement was awe inspiring.
Sent me down a little rabbit hole of Obama speeches. The dude is just class personified.
it was a genuine and authentic bromance. it wasn't easy at first. but by the end of the 2nd term, they were just the best.
They complimented each other perfectly: young, idealistic firebrand with a calmer, wiser OG to balance it out.
What about Trump and Pence? What a romance! Pence kissed his fat ass for 4 years, and was thanked with a noose.
The Bromance succeeded because V.P. Biden’s obsession with data and local conversations and converting that into Obamas Presidency. Naturally Joe still obsesses over good data and local conversations he’s the last to leave because he loves talking to people about their needs and achievements.



I aspire to be an 80 year old man who looks that dapper while standing next to my smokeshow of a wife (who also happens to be one of the smartest people I know).
Yes, it’s true. They have the style I aspire to.
He’s so dapper. Look at the double pockets!
Why is Jill holding like 3 coffees?
It’s one coffee. The other two are cups of virgin blood that must be fed to Dark Brandon on the hour, lest he consume the souls of every last person around him!
Because she's not beneath carrying someone else's coffee for them.
Can't wait for Blazergate
Biden's water bottle is pointed down, while his coffee cup is pointed up! The pocket flap on his jacket is slightly askew! These are definitely secret signals for Deep State operatives!
I love them both. I wish I could have ice cream with Joe.

Good, this will be another winning issue now.
I know old-school conservatives who are pissed at the Supreme Court. They don’t believe in immunity for any President, including Trump. This is the very issue that could, at the very least, keep them home on Election Day, even if they can’t quite bring themselves to vote blue.
You got immunity go for it
Hoorah!! I highly encourage to read this whole article. At least the first six paragraphs. Biden's got friends and he's a strategy man. For a guy his age, he sure knows how to move!! I'm very encouraged by his alliances.
Biden is a wise genius when it comes to navigating governments and global relationships to get things done, all the while looking out for the best interests of the United States as a whole. Biden is the best thing for the stability of the United States and leadership on the global stage.
EXPAND THE SCOTUS!!!
And impeach “Justices” Thomas and Alito for failure to recuse, financial corruption, and possible perjury as well!
nowwww we're cookin'
Now if we can just get Biden to pull a 1976 Jimmy Carter here in Texas, it would be a game changer for sure. Right now, Biden roughly at or slightly ahead of his 2020 numbers while the Senate race between Colin and Cancun Cruz is close. Can we pull it off with four months to go?
I am in Austin waiting to fly back, and I went to a Wal-Mart, and it was ALL minorities: Mexican and Black Americans. Texas is a really big state, though, so unfortunately, all the rural areas are likely white Republicans. Plus, I suspect the percentage of white voters who vote is higher versus minorities who do. Also, unfortunately, not a big enough margin of minorities of Mexican Americans historically vote for Democrats like Black Americans do.
I don't know how long it will take, but it definitely feels like a dam waiting to burst. If Democrats can get Texas and hold on to New York and California, that's 120 EV or 44% of the necessary 270 needed to win in just 3 states (6% of the 50 states). It would take a major shift for Republicans to make up those votes somewhere else.
Texas gained over a million people since 2020 and Trump’s margin there in 2020 was 600k votes so it’s possible!!
I want it so bad
Polls cannot be trusted. All that matters is the vote. Get out, get people engaged, make sure they know the issues and where Joe Biden stands and that he stands with the American people. Share links to Project 2025 so people can read the nightmare Trump has planned for the United States should he retake power. Information is the best weapon against a dictator like Trump.
Support Joe Biden and the Democrat party with everything you've got! VOTE!
Joe will win mark my words.
I hope Biden gets to have his Truman moment and pull off an upset.
And be remembered as one of the best presidents in us history mark my historian words
This is one of the few positive subs left. Bless this place.
Brilliant to send him out. Every news channel’s covering this thing like it’s the Super Bowl. He scored so much earned media for 20 minutes of work.
Wait, is the same Joe Biden who is not a convicted felon, can purchase a firearm and travel to countries like Australia and UK?
The Joe Biden who is free to run a charity if he wishes, that Joe Biden?
The very one!
Rooting for you Joe!
That's my President!
THATS MY PRESIDENT! Biden2024!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸👍✨️
Honest Reliable Joe.
I see Dark Brandon is ready
Unrelated, but Biden’s gonna start doing barbecues to reach out to voters, and that is a phenomenal idea.  Food and you get to meet this dude!
VOTE BLUE!!! 💙💙💙
That's a surprise! It's nice to have a thinking Republican. There really is no choice, it's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or nothing
Not a surprise if you’ve kept up with him. I disagree with him on many things but he’s one of the most sensible, level headed republicans around.
100%
Excerpts:
NEW YORK (AP) — Republican former congressman Adam Kinzinger endorsed President Joe Biden on Wednesday, giving the Democrat a prominent new ally in his high-stakes campaign to win over moderate Republicans and independents this fall.
Kinzinger, a military pilot who emerged as a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection, described Trump as “a direct threat to every fundamental American value” in a video announcing the endorsement.
“While I certainly don’t agree with President Biden on everything, and I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for president, I know that he will always protect the very thing that makes America the best country in the world: our democracy,” said Kinzinger, who voted for Trump in 2020.
“To every American of every political party and those of none, I say now is not the time to watch quietly as Donald Trump threatens the future of America,” said Kinzinger, who repeatedly described himself as a conservative in the video. “Now is the time to unite behind Joe Biden and show Donald Trump off the stage once and for all.”
Probably don’t agree with him on policy, but I am glad at least one republican has the balls to endorse Joe Biden.
Sick of hearing these anti Trump republicans say they are going to write in their mother or some stupid bullshit like that.
As an Illinois resident, I disagreed with Kinzinger on a lot of policy-related things, but the dude always seemed like a decent human being. Sadly, that can't be said for hardly any Republicans these days.
As an Illinois resident, I'd rather have him than lahood, though that's not a particularly high bar to clear.
So that's TWO Republicans with brains and integrity
This is really not news. Kinzinger has been supporting Biden for the last 3+ years
He's a good guy


Dark Brandon for the eternal win
I love the smirk when he heard the question lol
This and the singing the kid happy bday was dope to watch
This question should be a major news headline, not a by-the-way tweet
trump is just getting burned left and right and I am lovin' it
Actually, if he didn't have to give anything in return, why didn't he do it anyway. I mean he doesn't need presidential powers if he's not offering anything. If it would be that easy for him, why didn't he do it while rage tweeting?
Trump is that annoying a**hole braggart kid who everyone hated in school. He just never grew up.
Sounds like the kid in high school who totally had a girlfriend but she lives in Canada so you can't meet her.
He was the weird kid in class.
My quote of the day is David Frum saying he thinks the reason Putin gave the prisoners to Biden is because he doesn't think Trump will win anymore.
I am so stinking proud of Joe today🙂!


This lame duck bout to be fucking lit 🔥
YES AND I FUCKING LOVE IT
we gonna see what happens when a wise underestimated badass has nothing to lose !!!!
It’s a testament to how corrupt the court has become that Biden, a traditionalist in almost every sense, think that it needs a major overhaul. And is spending the last (likely) few months of his career trying to make it happen.
Depose and excommunicate Thomas and Alito!
Full immunity bro
Ultimate Biden Blast:
1.Executive order putting several new Supreme Court justices on the court
2.Let it get fought in court
3.Before it's overturned by the existing Supreme Court, the new liberal justice majority makes whatever Biden just did fine
4. Profit!
Then reverse all the shitty prior rulings by the Supreme Court (and even this ruling making whatever Biden did just fine) and reset everything back in time before Trump ruined everything in 2016
It’s going to be things like ethics rules, recusal requirements over conflicts of interests, and possibly age or term limits. I can’t see adding or replacing anyone immediately, so even age/term limits would likely have some transitional rules regarding current justices.
Good! Especially after the whole accepting luxury trips thing came out
I wonder if he hasn’t yet announced plans to expand the court out of fears he will be accused of “weaponizing the courts” by Republicans (not that they have any right to accuse anyone of that but still). I wish we could know that was the plan because short of removing Clarence Thomas and/or Alito etc. I don’t think there’s another way
