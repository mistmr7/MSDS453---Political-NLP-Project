Reddit is going to be insufferable.

Crazy that they found him guilty on ALL 34 charges
Not really, it was basically the same charge 34 times.
Aren't they all the same charges? If they found him guilty on one, it would follow to find him guilty on all.
do I upvote or downvote this post?
Oh man, I was totally going to vote for Trump but now I think I‚Äôll vote for Biden instead
‚Ä¶ said absolutely nobody.
You don't think there's some moderates who won't vote after conviction?


Chip Roy is right once again. It is vital that the GOP articulates a conservative vision to the country rather than simply say ‚ÄúDemocrats bad.‚Äù
Even better question: what did they do in 2017 and 2018 with complete control of all three branches?
Not shit.
What does he mean? The House has been working very hard; they've managed to elect a Speaker.
Spot on. Took over majority and let the clown brigade turn it into a circus.
GOP is losing me quickly
He is going to be waiting for a long time. The Republican Party is worthless and is nothing more than Democrat right.
Yeah we are looking fairly unappealing. If you look around our nation this next election should be easy peasy for us but it won‚Äôt be I am truly fearful that we‚Äôll end up losing congress and won‚Äôt take the white we just look like a bunch of whiners without solutions and just complaints. We need to tell our members of congress to do something and do it well.


50 is too young.
The man is a true hero, threw himself on top of his wife and daughter
His death is a tragedy, but reading the words of his daughter tells me he'd do it again in an instant. There is no cause more worthy than protecting your family.
May he rest in peace. True hero.
RIP a fire chief aswell. Will be a big loss to the community he served
Corey Comperatore. May his Soul Rest in Peace.
God rest his soul. He gave his life to save his family without a single thought of cowardice.
No matter what your political beliefs are, this was a completely and entirely pointless death. I may not agree with this man's politics but by his actions I can see that he is clearly a hero for protecting his daughter and wife. May he rest in peace and I hope his family is able to recover. Violence has absolutely no place in politics.
Whether you are left or right - you are not surprised. We finally have unity.
Mods clocking in for overtime in here today lmfao.
It‚Äôs even funnier to see how many comments are hidden from non flaired users lol.
Edit: first Reddit care message sent one hour after my comment. C‚Äômon brigadiers, y‚Äôall can do better.
I mean, we all kinda knew this would be the case.
The first step in a successful appeal is to lose at trial. -My Criminal Law Professor
The fastest way to end a war is to lose it.
This sure as shit is not your father‚Äôs America‚Ä¶
I mean yeah, Nixon cheated his way out of prison.
So do we think Biden is going to try to use this as a way to weasel out of the debates?
It would be funny to see Trump show up wearing an orange jumpsuit and in handcuffs debating Biden.
We need to do a better job ourselves to pick leaders who are aligned with the general populace than 2 ~80 year olds.
He could just shit his pants and get out of it that way
Is this what draining the swamp looks like?
Nice going everyone. Literally every person on the debate stage this primary would not have done this. We have no one to blame but ourselves.
Edit: who tf reported me to the Reddit suicide hotline over this?
Is anyone actually surprised though? Once he got his daughter in law as chair it was clear this is where it was heading. 
Uh, what? So we're just going to sacrifice the House and Senate, and hope Trump wins the general? Even if he does, he'll get sandbagged at every turn and without a conservative majority in congress, he won't be able to get anything done. I happen to care more about the future of my country, than just one man. This is not a smart plan.
Congressional races are going to struggle without funding and the next four years could be rough. And the GOP might not agree with him, but man are they going to miss McConnell‚Äôs fundraising power and managerial ability. This is why the modern GOP will struggle - no real ideology post Bush1 and reliance on one man to help maintain power. Cult-vibes.


One of the worst/best days of my life, my mother worked on the 96th fl and I did not know if she made it for 15 hrs since I was in LA. By some miracle she went to the other office on water st to pick up some papers.
What a miracle! I'm so glad!
I cannot even imagine the relief
rest in peace to all the victims of this act of evil
Never forget.
I will never forget.
I was in college and had slept in that morning.  A friend called and said that a plane had hit the World Trade Center.  We were under the impression it was a small aircraft and likely an accident, so we didn't think too much of it.
I walked to my first class where we learned a second plane had hit - clearly no accident.  The professor dismissed class immediately.
I remember how clear the sky was that day.  My university was in "flyover country" and there were no contrails left behind by passing jets.
I went back to my dorm and students were glued to the TVs downstairs.  We watched both towers crumble.  Everyone was screaming, crying, and hugging each other.
My parents were working overseas and told me how supportive everyone was.  With the exception of monsters dancing in the streets, the world mourned with us.
We were united then.  Now we have people claiming it never happened.  Disgraceful.
It is akin to Holocaust denial.  Just stop.
Rip, beautiful souls üôèüèª
Never forget that day. May all who died from those cowardly acts rest in peace, and may their families find comfort and peace.
Many people either weren't born or were very young when 9/11 happened and they question that it even occurred like it did. It's up to us to educate them so the victims are never forgotten and to make sure it never happens again.


Gotta give credit where credit is due. Fetterman has been doing a great job speaking out on these issues.
Jon Tester of Montana has also been a huge advocate of this and has bipartisan legislation with a Republican senator from SD called the PASS Act to stop our adversaries from buying farmland. This seems to be one of the unifying topics between both parties.
The John Fetterman redemption arc was definitely not on my 2023 bingo card.
TIL I support John Fetterman.
Is it possible Fetterman will end up doing a better job than Oz would have?
No doubt
i never ever ever thought i‚Äôd agree with him but on those points he‚Äôs correct
What a bizarre turn of events. Six months ago this guy was drooling out of the side of his mouth, could barley talk and was being paraded around as liberal socialist and now he is becoming the sole voice of anything even remotely resembling reason in the democrat party at the federal level. What is even happening here?
He strikes me as a labor Democrat. Classic FDR New deal type, maybe.
CNN claiming the same thing
As an Australian, it‚Äôs out sounding to see what is considering far left in American.
Walz would be considered centre left here.
IMO a good pick on their part. Everyone on here saying he's too far left but undecided voters don't vote on policy, if they did they wouldn't be undecided. He's got that "want to have a beer with" vibe.
He's more experienced than Vance too. The VP debate is going to be rough. I'm kind of hoping it won't happen now.
People on here saying this is good for us are just "coping" (as the kids say lol). He served 24 years in the national guard, had an A rating from the NRA when he was in Congress(and only got more liberal on the issue after the Parkland shooting, but still not totally anti-2A like the far left), has a moderate view on the Israel-Hamas war, is in favor of recreational marijuana, just to name a few things. The skeletons people talk about are more or less nothingburgers, his drunk driving incident happened in 1995 and he's been sober ever since. Considering Vance has made a point to talk about redemption from addiction, it would come off as hypocritical to criticize Walz for that incident. He's pretty much the best pick Harris could have made.
im trying not to doom spiral but this was a really good choice, honestly it was the one person i hoped she didnt pick. This dude has cool lovable grandpa energy and theres really nothing to pick him apart on. Even though hes super progressive i dont think moderates will care once they hear him talk, hes a good speaker. Seems like Kamala just wanted to cover her weak spots and go with a very safe likeable person, I think she may have succeeded. Heres to hoping im wrong.
It wasn't going to be Shapiro and you know why it wasn't going to be Shapiro.
What kind of candidate is he?
"one person‚Äôs socialism is another person‚Äôs neighborliness."
Well, I don't know much about him. Can someone enlighten me what comes next? Is this good or bad news for us?
I love the way the community notes heading is worded so passive aggressively.
I have never done any recreational drugs and probably never will but it's a winning issue so I really wish we'd jump on board with legalizing marijuana. Even if they never follow through on it, Democrats are at least talking about it and that's enough for a lot of young people.
I know Trump has briefly mentioned it this election cycle but at the same time you've got people like Desantis spending literally millions of dollars fighting against it.
I don‚Äôt think this is the ‚Äúdiss‚Äù you think it is. This shows that she thinks weed isn‚Äôt as bad as society has made it to be.
As a judge/lawyer, I don‚Äôt want you to make a decision on your personal beliefs. I want you to make a decision based on how the law is written. If we as a people do not like it, we will vote out anyone against it during the elections.
I won‚Äôt vote her because she‚Äôs a fraud in probably over a thousand ways, but this isn‚Äôt a good representation of that.
Except if you look at her history she didn't do that when it came to her corporate buddies. In what world do you live in where you think it is at all believable that Kamala was just blindly following the law because that's her guiding principle? Her princiole like all the other democrats that have ruined our justice system is what is best for her own personal gain - the law and everyone else be damned.
And prosecutors have discretion it's actually part of the job. They have to pick which crimes to prosecute or for dems more likely which of their enemies and politically disadvantaged people to target.
Lmao. She's such a fraud. It's crazy how many people don't see through it.
They know, just don't care.
It's all anti-Trump at this point.
Shit, John McCain is the new hero of the left FFS
Libs call Trump fake but then support Kamala.
They know, they just want to vote for not Trump
Can we just get a loop of Kamala getting bodied by Tulsi Gabbard during the Democratic primaries to reminds the Dems why she didn‚Äôt get it the nomination back then?
her version of " I tried it but did not inhale"
If we give congress term limits too, and Code of Conduct for Congress that includes a complete ban on stock trading while in congress, then sure I could go for this.
A complete ban on accepting gifts or tips of any kind, and requiring any meetings with elected officials or their staff be recorded.
Good luck getting congress to vote to restrict its own golden goose.
How about the same for Congress‚Ä¶.
I agree, I think all these positions have term limits. Congress too. We don't need a government of only 85 year olds
Wouldn‚Äôt they need a constitutional amendment for term limits on SCOTUS?
what, no limits for congress? fuck that!
Says the guy who was a senator for 36 years.
who only stopped because he got elected VP. otherwise he'd still be there, making it 50 years. and they don't force you to step down from the Senate when you're completely senile.


I'm shocked he actually pulled out.
He actually dropped out? Wow
Who's going to be his replacement?
Feels like I'm in a real-life House of Cards episode.
I'll be the first to admit that months ago I didn't think he'd actually do it and I was wrong.
An assassination attempt on Trump and Biden dropping out within a week of each other. All I can say is wow.
He just endorsed Harris in another tweet
This is huge
I wish him the best. He deserves to spend his final years with his friends and family.
Very surprising. But lets take a step back and appreciate that Joe Biden stepped down. I did not dislike him. I really disliked his vision and platform for the country, but he gave it his best as he could and I recognize that. I wish the president an easier and calmer way of life moving forward with less stress. Man served in politics forever and rose to the presidency. Respect.ü´°
Nice to hear some decency and respect across party lines. Respect.


When has the gov ever put them first? They send them to die but still put them last when they‚Äôre back.
Which conservatives vote in favor of helping homeless? Or even programs which provide housing for homeless vets specifically?
This is my main issue with these posts. It's always, "why should i help this group of people that I don't consider worthy over another group of people that i do?" Then when people agree that we should help the second group of people (in this case veterans), the goal posts get moved one way or the other. At the end of the day, people that say things like this don't really want to help anyone (except themselves).
Aren't conservatives like.. outlawing helping homeless people whenever they can? Isn't feeding the homeless illegal in red states?
e: This thread is clearly being brigaded, but I'd love for an actual conservative to defend the conservative record on combatting homelessness. I don't see any serious, specific policy proposals from the right on this issue, other than "free the market and it'll all work out"
I see a lot of blaming RINOs or whatever, but what bills have been shot down by them? You had both chambers and the presidency during Trumps first two years. Was a single bill even brought to the floor on this?
Like, let me lay some back of napkin math out here to demonstrate how much you could do. Depending on the org doing the estimate, ballpark is about 35,000 homeless vets in America.
For a billion dollars, you could literally just hand every single one of them a 30k check. So lets triple it- 3 billion dollars and you could put each and every one of them in a mobile home- paid and clear. That is a third of the current cost of Trump's additions to the border wall/fence.
3 billion dollars and you eradicate homelessness in veterans. That's it. We spend 18 billion a day on defense. Break out the crayons and explain the problem, other than a complete lack of political will?
And what Republican supported piece of legislation has been put forward to help this situation?
Why are people pitting two working class groups against each other?
Why is it never "Homeless Servicemen should come before any billionaire"?
Instead of giving more tax breaks to the rich, maybe we should keep their taxes high like they were after World War II and use those funds to help all working people.
It's wild to me how there is such a poor understanding of how systems and laws in the US actually work. Unauthorized migrants are not eligible to receive benefits from the majority of federal programs. Even legal immigrants are not eligible until they have resided in the country for 5 years. It has been shown time and time again that generally even unauthorized migrants are not a tax burden at a federal level. States and local communities are a different story but those are not and should not be addressed at a federal level.


Mind blowing that someone with a rifle gets 150 yards from a political candidate and former president. The rally was in a damn field with all of 2 buildings and it wasn‚Äôt secured??
Where in the blue fuck was their guardian angel, asleep?
Secret service needs to get their heads out of their asses
‚ÄúMuch bleeding took place‚Äù is such a Trump sentence lol, I can read it in his voice
No matter who we support we must never support violence.
No one wins. Always condemn it.
Where are the comments going?
Glad he‚Äôs okay. Tragic that some innocent lost their life because of the actions of some coward. I hope Trump and Biden both have increased protection around them in light of this incident, this has potential to escalate which is concerning, no matter what you think politically, a nominee or president being assassinated is a disgrace and I pray they both can continue appearing in public without an incident like this happening again. Already seeing people dismiss this incident as staged which is just disgusting. Anyone who believes a past and most likely future president would allow himself, as long as three of his supporters to be shot needs their heads checked.
Glad he‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not a fan of him, but violence like this has absolutely no place in America.
It should be noted how incredibly lucky trump is, you can see the photo of where he was hit. If it had been slightly different he would have died. If the shooter hadn't missed the first shot he would have died, if he had reacted to the first shot even slightly slower he would have died.
Its a miracle he's alive.
I am glad he is OK. But it's just very heartbreaking someone just attending a rally was killed and injured too. Let's not forget that. I am very upset where our country is going. Even prior to this. This whole thing happening today reeks of third world country bullshit that that this country has become. I am still voting Trump more then ever now


I see no lie
"Nuh uh!!!! Kamala Harris is the smartest woman to ever exist!!!" ~Joy Scarborough
The few places in CA which understand.
Long Beach, CA. is very liberal. I'm sure the troglodytes at r/longbeach are frothing at the mouth over there saying a bunch of racist things about MAGA's.
This is a good sign that even in liberal states people are finally waking up to the leftist plan to destroy this country.
The Bay Area dominates worst coast politics, increasing portions of the state just vote for free whatever as people who vote otherwise and lose gradually leave the state. I've been seeing it since the early 90s, it only seems to be gaining momentum and California isn't running out of people thanks to the border czar.
Ive actually seen trump flags in chicago......i was shocked and almost hit another car doing a double take.
There‚Äôs plenty of conservatives in every state. They are just outnumbered. Helped along by the 10‚Äôs of millions who have flooded in over the years.
Heroes don‚Äôt always wear capes. Sometimes they put up signs on highways to upset Californians.
Nice to see my fellow Californians giving her the finger lol
Wait, on the genz sub, they said it was only one single separated case.
1900 is a bit more than one case
Did you notice that millennials, genz, and genx all appeared on the front page at the same time with identical messaging?
I didn‚Äôt know that that the defining characteristic of all three of these generations was far left politics, but based on Reddit data, that is absolutely the case.
I mean she prosecuted what was illegal at the time. She was doing her job. She can do her job and not agree with the law.
Agreed. She could also change her views over time as facts and America changes. I wish she would own it though and not act like it did not happen.
Yeah the law sucked ass at the time. There‚Äôs a lot of other things to NOT like her for but she was honestly just doing her job. Law and order.
Popcorn time
Unburdened by what has been...
Edit: It's crazy even trash talking Kamala is getting upvotes in typically left subs... I guess the BURDEN IS REAL!
Just waiting for the passage of time


To this day, I still do not understand the left's embrace of Islam. It's literally everything that they claim to hate and label conservative Christians to be. 
Because they hate white people and Judeo-Christian principles.
This is a perfect example of ‚Äúthe enemy of my enemy is my friend‚Äù
"Well, obviously, I'm not gonna be telling the same jokes about Muhammad I'd feel very comfortable saying about Jesus Christ and that's because, fun fact, I am not a fucking idiot. So, if you are a Christian and you are sat there thinking, well, that's not fair, he makes jokes about Christians all day long but he won't make the same sort of jokes about Muslims, well, them maybe as a Christian you should think about blowing something up. No one is scared of you, what are you gonna do, forgive me?"
Jimmy Carr
This pretty much sums it up.
That's really the whole base of it. You can make fun of Christians without much fear of death. Not so much Islam. Look at Charlie Hebdo. At the end of the day, the OP is looking at a cartoon that is trying to make money. Being edgy about Christiam stuff makes money. Putting Muhammed in a joke gets your employees murdered.
Muhammad (piss be upon him) called for all his critics to be put to death. The Muslims who do that today are following their prophet's decrees.
They‚Äôll never make fun of Islam because they‚Äôre terrified of Islamic extremists. But, with how antisemitic much of the left has become recently, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we start seeing more bashing of Judaism.
Is this from the new Futurama episodes? I don't remember this from the older episodes or even from the episodes after it was brought back the first time.
i think it might be part of the newer revival. Watched the entire series multiple times and don't remember this scene


Bonus points for realism.
Minus some points for not sniffing kids. Immersion breaking
/s
Good impression. The only thing that the kid missed was the shuffling. Biden doesn't walk that well.
As Shane Gillis says, he turns into a Roomba after a speech
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted but it‚Äôs fucking weird when young kids dress up in costumes like this.
That's what I was gonna say. You already know all their parents talk about is politics. If I have kids I'm hoping they don't feel pressured into anything. I want them to shape their own beliefs politically and religiously. Any influence on my behalf would feel like I'm brainwashing them.
lol, love it
"get up Mr president!."
I hope he would just wonder away as the other two got.candy lol
There is a man who follows the prince everywhere he goes simply because he is organ compatible with him.
Now that's a guy who hopes the prince doesn't get sick.
Best gig in the world until he needs something you only have one of
I know a guy who knows a guy who was yacht shopping and toured a boat owned by the Aga Kahn. It had two side-by-side operating rooms in it. The guy was like ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶I guess I understand having an operating room, but why two?‚Äù
You need one to pull the organ out of the live (at least up until that point) donor and another for the waiting recipient. The live donor lives a good life while he is alive and his family is taken care of forever.
This video is fucking hilarious.
he he, you‚Äôre still human buddy
Good thing he wasn‚Äôt in Saudi Arabia huh? lol. Fair game
They wouldn't have done shit
This is so great just because you know Trump, and someone said you can‚Äôt touch him.
‚ÄúWatch this‚Äù
They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to trade.
How this isn‚Äôt a bipartisan demand by the voters is absolutely beyond me. This just keeps happening on both sides of the aisles!
She will just have family members trade.
We should make all politicians dump all private investments. Jimmy Carter sold his damn peanut farm to ensure that there could be ZERO potential conflict of interest between himself and his finances, why the hell don't we make the rest of them do that?
...because if SHE gets investigated for insider trading, THEY ALL DO.
That's fine with me.
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
When you allow people to gather power to themselves they will use that power for themselves. Term limits and laws to restrict the abuse of the public trust would be good starting places.
Originally political positions were positions of serving the community, no pay, it kept them in check. Between that and term limits for every position, and no life long retirement.
Liberals will call me out for my "both sides" argument but this right here is a serious issue that both parties should crack down on. So many greedy politicians in America
This isn't a partisan issue. Almost everyone not in the .1% has issue with this.


Much respect to Evan Vucci, who took this picture, and the other photographers who when the sounds of bullets were still ringing in the air rushed to take what they knew were going to be defining photographs for the history of America.
It's a pretty easy Pulitzer prize for him imo.
This pic goes hard AF.
it's legendary and the photog just bagged jis Pulitzer.
I've always been a critic of Trump but his reaction is the best since my favorite president of all time Teddy Roosevelt and now I got some respect for the guy.
My first thought when I saw it: There's his new campaign poster.
I saw several people referring to the event as ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs deadly Pennsylvania rally‚Äù. Absolutely insane.
This was the Time cover I was hoping for once that photo hit the streets, but I wasn't sure they'd print it. I'm sure it makes him look way too heroic for their liking. It's the most badass Presidential photo of my lifetime, and I'm not young.
An audience member is also dead and another critically injured. Just awful
AP says two killed now.
Gunman is dead, per Fox News
Why did the two previous posts get locked??
Mods are locking and deleting everything but a few posts.......
Make of that what you will....
Trying to consolidate posts about Trump rally to the mega thread. This isn‚Äôt quite as related
Holy shit the comments on political pages right now shows how far people have become brain rotten. Everybody is echoing the same 2 things.
If this was Biden or any democrat there would be absolute chaos unfolding. Riots against gun ownership. Protesting every single republican. Threats upon threats of retaliation. Fucking backwards world.
Apparently an attendee was killed, there‚Äôs a report someone in the front row was hit in the head.
They‚Äôre deranged.
Edit: just saw a clip of a guy with blood on his shirt that said he tried to help the person shot in the head. The way he was talking, I‚Äôm not sure that person was actually dead. Wishing them the best if they‚Äôre still alive somehow.
I would expect a lot of bans forthcoming for threatening violence but I know better.  
‚Äú either way we need to secure the schools next week.thats going to be the first target if there‚Äôs some sort of right wing counterattack ‚Äú -someone on politics. WTF??! Seriously, wtf?
Does this count as news? Hasn‚Äôt he already indicated stuff like this before?
Yeah, hardly a surprise to anyone.
We all know you voted for Biden, Mittens.
And Hillary before that.
Of course he would. The only reason he was ever considered a Republican is because he was Governor of Massachusetts, a state so far to the left that most Democrats are classified as Republicans there.
We can laugh all we want but without the sizable percentage of people who also think like that, Biden will be easily re elected.
You can‚Äôt win a presidential election with your only strategy being doubling down on your base. It didn‚Äôt work for Bernie and it won‚Äôt work for Trump.
So voting with his true party.
The Uniparty.
He probably voted for the Democrat in 2016 and 2020.
And 2012
What is the issue here? She was VERY precise about her explanation. A reasonable and intelligent viewpoint.
This is what I hate. The intellectual dishonesty. Oprah is sitting there acting like that‚Äôs so Raven is trying to teach her differential equations.
Tiger Woods also took some heat for claiming all of his different roots, and not outright claiming his African heritage on Oprah.
Because he is mostly Asian
Give this woman a üèÜ! Why do we need to label people based on the color of their skin or ethnicity?? We should all just be proud Americans! üá∫üá∏üí™
She's not from any country in Africa. She was born in the US. She's American.
Notice how Oprah continues to bait and then dismiss her. What a turd.
Oprah fed young women to Harvey Weinstein and god knows who else.
Love it. Reject division and embrace unity


I‚Äôm already seeing the spin. ‚ÄúNo no that‚Äôs just a dangerous area, not a war zone!‚Äù
But then they also said walz served in a war by being in Italy?
The people trying to "fact check" this are hilarious. It's painfully obvious that they've never been in the military because if they had they'd recognize the inside of that tent and would understand opsec and how they aren't just gonna come out and say where they are.
We talk about the 13 that died during the Afghanistan withdraw.
3 were killed THIS year in "Jordan" on the border to Syria.
https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3659809/3-us-service-members-killed-others-injured-in-jordan-following-drone-attack/
im just curious how many places we are currently involved...
ok i found a chart that had 21 land and 7 sea areas listed places as combat zones we're in... wtf? and its just showing the middle east mostly idk if there's anywhere else.
They might get in trouble for posting that
They will.
my nephew is serving in Saudi right now... working in F16s... so yeah.
Chicago?
That's a warzone.... last time I checked.
I‚Äôd just like to mention that this opinion is extremely readable for people like me who do not have a legal background. I‚Äôd encourage anyone who has strong feelings either way about this opinion to actually read it. It took me maybe 30m, and I learned a lot from it.

Good. We don't want presidents with immunity.
This isn't just about Trump, his arguments are setting a precedent for all presidents going forward.
All presidents should be held accountable for criminal conduct in office. This includes Biden, Trump, Clinton, and any other future president too.
It‚Äôs amazing how many MAGA people who let their fandom of him get in the way of this reasonable position.
Turns out the writers of the constitution really didn‚Äôt want a king.
It‚Äôs a shame that so many citizens actually do.
Crazy right?
He doesn‚Äôt need immunity. I‚Äôll not trade protecting trump so Biden can have immunity down the road. No. Republican leaders must be willing to be subject to laws if they want the trust of the people.
Yeah he was never winning this and for good reason. The branches keep each other in check, having a president immune to the judicial branch would essentially give us a king rather than a president.
I prefer presidents who don't believe that they are, or even that they should be, immune to criminal prosecution.
His defense speaks to his very mindset: 'As President, I can do what I want'. Multiple members of his administration resigned or were fired for repeatedly telling him the limits of the presidential powers.
I'm not saying he wants to be a dictator. I'm saying, he seems incapable of wrapping his head around the job. He views the presidency as the CEO of the country. It is not.
Her economic plan is almost as good as her border plan.
The ABC Moderators should be publicly shamed for their pathetic attempt at fact checking.
Maybe a small fraction of the people who watched the debate will hear about this
Pretty much the only people who will see this are people already voting for Trump while more Haley RINOs will just blindly vote for Kamala.
If she wasn't lying she wouldn't be talking
Where were all the ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù on this one?
Anyone who declares themselves to be a fact-checker is not a fact-checker.
ANYTIME her lips are moving, she is lying.
Why didn't they fact-check her on that /s
Pshhh, why are you even bringing up something from more than a couple of days ago? What, are you some kind of Historian or something? You know history is racist, right? And if you‚Äôre spending so much time in history, you‚Äôre probably one of those History Bigots. And, let me tell you something about those people, they have no place in our future. We are turning the page on what has been so we may finally be holistically unburdened by what has been.
OBEY
Your thirst
The power of propaganda. The sheep don't know when they are brainwashed.
It's even worse. They think we're the ones who are brainwashed.
It's like Reagan said, the problem isn't even that they're ignorant it's that they know so much that isn't so (aka. brainwashed). In all seriousness, this is what happens when you give the government control over education. Surprise surprise they teach the population to love the government and hate their political opponents...
All you need to do is look at the Reddit main page to see how bad the left-wingers are brainwashed
Typically a population who is convinced they are least susceptible to propaganda are actually quite susceptible to it. It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very important for everyone, including us, to accept the notion that we can understand or hold the wrong view on something and be open to changing our mind.
Biden is the most mentally fit President ever and oh yeah don't you know it was obvious he was in mental decline Kamala will come in and fix all the issues we have since we've only had the presidency for 12 out of the last 16 years. Trump's a racist felon! RACIST
Don‚Äôt forget trump endangers our democracy

Take that a step further.
If the market is up today, they‚Äôll say that‚Äôs all Biden and Harris. If the market is down today, they‚Äôll say it‚Äôs fallout from Trump‚Äôs policies.
The freaking Secretary of Commerce didn‚Äôt even know that the Board of Labor Statistics (and not Trump) is who stated that job numbers were over-reported by over 800,000.
They‚Äôre simply the most incompetent, dishonest piles of crap I have ever seen in my 30+ years of following politics.


You forgot that he was also honored by Coretta Scott King and Jesse Jackson for his contributions to the black community.
Truly a giant bigot.
Trump is literally Hitler.
John McCain, when he ran, was literally Hitler.
Hell, even Milquetoast Mit Romney, when he ran, was literally Hitler.
Trump also personally backed Jesse Jackson in the Independent Party Presidential run and bankrolled him, and was personal close friends with Jesse Jackson.
But ya, he's a racist.
Yeah but that was when he was a democrat. They loved Elon Musk the EV king until he switched sides too.
I believe he's also the only US President that isn't descended from slave owners.
I'm not entirely unconvinced that Biden has slaves somewhere in a basement.
Remember, they never had a problem with him until he became a Republican.
Trump was never racist. He has been in public for many decades. Try to find any accusation from before 2016, there are none. It is all made-up.
Edit: Hello downvoters and brigadiers. Much easier to downvote than to find an example of Trump being racist :)
I recall when ‚Äúthey‚Äù called Mr Trump a slumlord and took advantage of the Blackman because he received a letter in the mail from the state of New York demanding that he fix problems and rent his properties according to the fair housing act‚Ä¶
But‚Ä¶.what ‚Äúthey‚Äù left out of this accusation was the FACT that every single landlord in the state received the very same exact letter,it turned out to be a blanket mailing because of a regulation change..
Pitiful communists‚Ä¶.like then‚Ä¶they are now grasping for something to grab unto as they fall.
