Seriously though. My history teacher once told me that women under the Soviet Union were more liberated than other parts of the world because they had access to abortion.
That‚Äôs insane, the red army were feared in Europe for their mass rapings
Don't let the loud minority fool you, we aren't that substantially more pro-abortion than our predecessors.
Main difference is just that people with concerns about the practice feel more pressure to remain silent.
Honestly between media and personal groups I couldn't tell you if we are becoming more or less prolife/prochoice rn
id actually argue were more pro life ive heard that ever since ultra sounds more people have been pro life
Hate to break to them but they aren‚Äôt liberated they are freely enslaving themselves to the abortion industry


Yep!! It feels like I was born in the wrong generation
Every generation got their big evil.
Well you know, without abortion women are reduced to slaves, so‚Ä¶ \s
Yes! This is exactly what it feels like. Especially when they say, ‚ÄúYou hate women you pathetic loser‚Äù like it‚Äôs a comeback, although it is so illogical. As a man, I literally cannot discuss this topic without being the subject of ad hominem attacks about my character. And I have never been upvoted for it either.
That's Reddit for you, full of selfish inconsiderate people who care more about having a convenient sex life than about ensuring the lives of children are protected.
I know it feels like that, but they‚Äôre just loud. We‚Äôre far from alone, and we‚Äôre stronger together.
Accurate especially as a woman. Shocker, I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúright‚Äù to kill my babies in the womb. They‚Äôd burn me at the stake if they could lol
Mmmm.... not really. There's a lot of pro-lifers out there. Most just don't speak up because they don't feel like ruining their day with nasty comments from a crazy, entitled pro-choicer.
And you're never going to find many of them on the leftist cesspool that is Reddit.
There are more than you think. We need to be more vocal
It doesn't matter.
Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus.
There's a lot more of us than they want us to realize.
Such a valuable fight. Press on!!!
Stupid people come in masses.
I think that makes her a deadbeat mom, no?
Deadbeat Mom>Murderer
A win is a win!
Maybe, we'd have to look for the full story, maybe she left them but is paying him as the law demands, things would be so much better if all pro choicers who don't want to take care of a kid simply allowed the kid to live and handled the guard to the other parent after the kid is born while of course paying Alimony.
Everyone ends up happy that way, but pro choicers can't accept their mistakes , and end up doing the wrong thing
I saw this post on another sub with a gazillion comments defending the imaginary mom for not wanting the baby
But real dads in identical situations not wanting to keep their children are vilified
Edit: Don't get me wrong, I think parents should be held responsible for their child's care all around.
I also saw this on another thread and one of the people there literally holds the opinion that this kid would have been better off aborted, not just because he claims that the father "abused" the mother by getting her to have the child instead of aborting it like she originally wanted, but because he thinks the life the child will live is just not worth living.
It makes me wonder what the rates of depression and suicdal tendencies are among pro-choicers compared to pro-lifers.
Insane how people can see this and get angry that the baby he is holding isn‚Äôt dead.
Probably just rage bait, and the Pro-Abortion folks fell for it.
imagine being a person once the baby is out of the womb STILL saying they should have been killed
Very common sadly, even said to my face about my mom(she is a born alive survivor
All laws force beliefs on other people
Lmao this literally just happened to me
Me too!
I feel like the biggest fallacy the pro-choice side has is that they believe ALL pro-life people are fundamentalist evangelical Christians. There are plenty of pro-life atheists, agnostics, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jews. 
After all, they need a boogeyman of the fundie to sustain their illogical arguments
This was my ex, she asked me if I was pro-choice and I told her I was pro-life. She immediately started crying after. It was baffling, she was acting as if I just told her I was cheating on her.
"Can you honestly stop trying to enslave me and regulate my body?"
It‚Äôs actually weird when these people equate religion with this. It‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúLet me do my evil stuff! What do you mean I should be held accountable?!‚Äù
You don‚Äôt even need to be religious to be pro-life. The reasons I am pro-life are for secular reasons, because the science shows that a human life begins at conception.
Shit this sucks so much but the logic tracks. I hate that everyone is expected to provide adequate care and support to the child EXCEPT the mother. Obviously I agree the men need to be in their children's life (or at the absolute bare minimum be paying child support) but the fact that women can decide whether they want to provide for their child or literally just kill them to get "the inconvenience" out of the way is just mind-blowing.
And he didn't necessarily kill anybody doing it.
For some reason that was the closest flair I could do. Haha sorry.
You got a point there.
Men love abortions because it frees them from 18-24 years of financial responsibility.
And where are my "reproductive rights" as a man, huh?
I'll quote Dave Chapelle: "If the woman gets to kill the kid, the man should at least get to abandon it."
This is so true
"Your body my wallet", it's such a sad outcome, but the logic seems to imply that's the trend we will eventually adopt.
As a woman, I absolutely agree!!
The logic sticks.
The group that screenshots our posts and comments is going to have fun with this one
Do they not know what fertilization is?
Even if it was fertilized, we still eat chicken so the embryo forming is irrelevant. Although it is still an "egg" since the egg is the life support for the embryo and fertilization doesn't change the part that we know of as "the egg", that is still the hen's DNA.
pArtY oF scIEnCe
So, interesting take I heard recently. These people are actually more religious than the religious people they make fun of.
You‚Äôll often hear them not saying‚Ä¶ ‚Äútrust science‚Äù. No, you‚Äôll hear them say ‚Äútrust THE science‚Äù.
To them, there‚Äôs a greater authority; a higher power if you will; that has the ultimate say, and they take it on faith that what ‚Äúthey‚Äù say is true. Not only that, but they will zealously defend what ‚Äúthey‚Äù say and lambast anyone they deem a heretic.
The left have become Spanish Inquisition, and if they could torture and forcefully convert us, I have no doubt they‚Äôd reach levels of previous abuses of religious influence rarely seen in history (that part is my own opinion, but I think it‚Äôs well founded)
Even beyond not understanding that these are not fertilized and thus there are no aborted chickens, does he think we are all vegan or something? If we eat adult chickens why couldn‚Äôt we eat aborted ones? Chickens aren‚Äôt human. Surprise, surprise!
People think pro life means prolife for everything including animals lol no im prolife for the innocent unborn babies and children! Meanwhile they are crying over a video of a clam being opened up for pearls but are okay with their own species being ripped apart üôÑ
In some countries fetal poultry are served in the egg as a delicacy... Granted I've never eaten those before, but even if a lot of people would find that gross there's nothing ethically wrong with consuming livestock that young unless you object to eating meat.
Human women have eggs too. Those are not aborted humans. They are eggs. If this person doesn‚Äôt understand maybe they never heard the story starting with ‚Äúwhen a man and a woman love each other very much‚Ä¶‚Äù
I‚Äôve raised chickens for years and I love when they try to use this argument. Because it‚Äôs just so easy to tear apart that a child could do it.
The pro-abortion crowd never seems to understand the difference between balut and the eggs they get from the supermarket.
Even without marriage, people shouldn't fucking abandon their kids.
I have a great proposition, it‚Äôs a lifelong commitment to this person and you‚Äôre willing to have kids to raise together. You can even signify your exclusiveness with like a gold ring or something.
Maybe even some kind of ceremony in front of your friends and family to celebrate the occasion?
Have a big party to celebrate, and then commemorate it every year.
They‚Äôre so stuck with thinking of us as just wanting to control women that they think it‚Äôs some kind of gotcha when they say that when in reality most of us would agree
It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt actually understand us and think we‚Äôre like them. Hence all the projection.
Yeah it‚Äôs always funny lol many more pro-life folks would agree with this take than pro-choice folks. It‚Äôs the kind of people to abandon their kids that would be pro-choice the most.


I mean I'm all for marriage but you could not marry and still not abandon the kid.  Like yeah men should not be abandoning their kids 
What is child support and partial custody Alex?
I was having a chat about feminism with a girlfriend of mine (not my actual girlfriend but just a girl I'm friends with) a few weeks ago.
I have nothing against feminism, I think it's a great thing. But it feels like the "feminism" the pro-choice left uses is nothing more than a "women should be able to do whatever they want without consequences" excuse or how men suck and how much better women are. It kind of annoys me.
Which is why I‚Äôm antifeminist
THIS. agreed 100%
You see I'm pro-choice but I agree with that sentiment and how "oH mEn SucK" but same vice versa as well with the misogyny and sexism, this gender war is stupid and we live in stupid times. I guess being a moderate for equal and individual rights has to be one extreme or the other.
Current feminists have little in common with first wave feminists
Or women in general.
As the pro-life activist and philosopher Stephanie Gray once asked: "When does women's right start? It starts when women start existing. And that is in the womb"
True, I'm a Pro-life feminist :)
They were against hormonal contraceptives too because they were afraid it would contribute to male sexual promiscuity. They were right.
100%
I am Catholic, but I absolutely agree. It‚Äôs an issue of human rights, you don‚Äôt need any religious beliefs to fight for life. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who tells you otherwise.
Yup. Especially seeing as I believe that this life is all we have. In my view cutting a life short is morally worse in a worldview with no afterlife. (At least I assume that religious folks believe that unborn humans go to heaven if they die?) 
As far as I can tell, the pro choicers are the ones making it seem all pro lifers are religious fanatics.
It's sad that the religious ppl in this sub always have shitty comments about anyone who's not religious and prolife.
The prolife movement will never be successful if it's viewed as a religious movement. Ill never understand why prolifers don't want all people to be prolife.
As a ""religious"" person I disagree with the "shitty comments", but the
is spot on.
as a religious pro lifer I respect non religious pl's more since they came to the conclusion that its wrong on their own esp while surrounded by ppl who are pc
can relate. once a woman here said "my points/views are void if i ain't christian" and I'm like wtf is this logic.
I am Orthodox and I agree. Anyone can defend life, no matter what they believe (or not) in. ü©∂
I never understood why being against killing of the defenseless made me a ‚Äúright wing fascist‚Äù or a ‚Äúreligious nut job‚Äù it‚Äôs odd to me when I see people who say they advocate for the marginalized but then completely ignore the unborn.
Cue the relative morality verses objective morality philosophical debate


The West will whine day in and day out about eugenics programs by Nazis while simultaneously supporting eugenics programs today 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve eradicated Down Syndrome in our society! And all it took was killing all of the people with Down Syndrome! How great are we, right?‚Äù
Next they'll move onto Autism, OCD, ADD/ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, etc. They never stop at one.
Canada & Switzerland are already leading the way.
That's horrible! My birth mom drank alcohol while pregnant w me and I worry that if she had been pregnant nowadays in the US, people would have tried to convince her to abort me. I hate this kind of pro-choice argument. It's so ableist.
When can this be considered a hate crime?
It‚Äôs more than that, it‚Äôs a genocide.
My cousin had Down syndrome. He was one of the kindest people I've met in my life. I met him at one of my moms relatives' weddings. He saw me sitting alone and asked me to dance. It's so sad that people like him get treated like they're a problem.
Also, to add to that. My son was diagnosed with Down Syndrome in the womb. He ended up not having it.
Praise God

Amen. Or the young woman on the left wouldn't even exist üòû.
Hail allah
Great signs.
Some joy got brought back to my life.
This why as many people as possible should be on the sidewalk in front of the abortion center to save mothers and babies from murder.
Amazing
Beautiful story.
Trauma doesn‚Äôt heal trauma.
Rape is not a justification for abortion. There are better ways to support victims, such as medical care
Thank you! Dunno a thing about Brazil politics but I feel like almost no one is talking about this in the US, it's either kill the baby or force the mother to deal with unwanted pregnancy with absolutely no assistance
Okay, but also the mother doesn‚Äôt need to actually keep the child, either. Adoption is the right option for many who don‚Äôt want to kill a child, but also haven‚Äôt decided to be mothers.
She acted extremely immature during this section of the debate. I expected better from someone going into criminal justice.
She was infuriating to watch. The way she wished rape on a 10 year old daughter to prove her point, that was evil.
Don't act surprised
Who is that?
From this video. It‚Äôs a really good watch imo. Except for a few cases most of the students were civil and well spoken.
Recent Charlie Kirk video. 
This one is worthy of love ONLY because she is a human being...and that's just by a hair.
She shows herself to be a vile person.
They blame the unborn child for themselves getting pregnant
Sometimes, they blame him because it's obviously his fault for inseminating her.

Who put that fetus there?!?!?!?!
The Patriarchy made them do it, duh.
C'mon. You know they expected a flat screen TV as a trade off. üòÇ
It‚Äôs choice playing victim when they had a active hand in the child‚Äôs creation
In the words of Fulton Sheen, "having lost the purpose of life which religion supplied, modern man became increasingly frustrated as his disappointed hedonism turned to pessimism. Thus man, who isolated himself from the religious community, now by reaction finds himself absorbed by the political community as despair becomes the dominant note of contemporary philosophy and literature."
No way, you get pregnant after getting sex? You‚Äôre not joking!?
It‚Äôs insanely sad how common this thought process is.
Perhaps you are aware, but it is literally a commonly held belief for a certain group of people of a particular political persuasion that "consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy".
"What if it's disabled?"
"what if its (any category of people that wouldve been sorted out by eugenics in ww2)"
What if it will grow up poor or face any hardship in life?
Easier to get into heaven!
‚ÄúWhat if its making a pro gamer move by doubling up on the chromosomes?‚Äù
The passage in Numbers 5 has nothing to do with an abortion.
Thank you for being a voice for all those babies out there ü©∑
I‚Äôm so happy to have found this group . No one around me understands the pro life movement and they look down on it . Nice to see so many people fight for the unborn
Congrats
Yes both are true, there thankfully weren‚Äôt many protestors either.
That's so awesome! Murder will one day be abolished in Ohio and eventually the whole nation. The results were unfortunate last time but we will keep shining!
And keep trying. Slavery was legal once and seemed permanently entrenched. The odds against toppling it must have seemed insurmountable.
Even as I am a Catholic, human rights is the most important issue and respect for human life is more simply important than other issues some might pick on with that shirt. Thank you for wearing that.
Jesus taught us to love all as our neighbor. We are not judges.
Pregnant women. Ftfy.
So proud of you. Keep up the good work.
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised this hasn‚Äôt been downvoted like crazy
The comments ARE full of screeching pro-choicers though sadly
I am, too. However, I do think some on the left are waking up to the fact that demonizing parents and the future of humanity itself is politically asinine.
I literally was talking to one an hour ago talking about ‚Äúwe all die anyways‚Äù lack of empathy, pro violence and death. No surprise. I genuinely don‚Äôt know how you grow so detached to the suffering of others.
That's disturbing. I don't get how anyone can be that way either. I would guess it's someone who's been through a lot themselves and just let it ruin them instead of growing from it.
Arm yourselves with this: a parasite is defined as a SEPARATE species than the host. If they‚Äôre gonna have to stoop to stupidity, we can at least match it with education.
I'm not good with children, especially not babies, but even my heart melts when a baby laughs. I don't think there's anything more pure on Earth than that.
It is also scientifically inaccurate. A fetus is of the same species as the mother, while a parasite is a different species. I would say the relationship is symbiotic. The mother becomes much less vulnerable to gynecological cancers and uterine infections while she is pregnant, and her immune system strengthens. Just like how the mother provides maternal immunoglobulins to her baby, the baby also provides the mother with fetal stem cells that will proliferate and differentiate.
Calling a baby a "parasite", or "uterus booger", just makes me feel that the person saying it is dirty. Like, there's normal people, then there's this gross bitch, loudly being foul and demanding about what they might want removed from their body.
Calling it a parasite is also biologically incorrect. The relationship between a fetus and the mother is a mutualism relationship. The mother provides benefits to the child and the child provides benefits to the mother.
I was volunteering at a pro life booth at a local fair and we were giving out similar things. It's good to show the reality of unborn children and what they look like so people can better understand the context of what abortion is and does. A lot of younger people were shocked.
Mothers have a natural (and very important) instinct to protect their babies, and that would only be intensified if they could see what they looked liked in the womb.
I have no doubt in my mind that less woman would desire an abortion if they knew exactly what their child looked like at the time of the operation.
It‚Äôs almost hilarious that this is the thing that made me pro-life or at least heavily shaped me, but my very pro-choice, educated, well-versed in science relative gave me a book as a child about fetal development. If I‚Äôm not mistaken a lot of the photos were actually of babies that were going to be aborted (I had asked how they safely took photos of the babies at each stage and was then told they were going to die anyway so there were no ethical concerns with using equipment to photograph them üò≥. I wish I still had the book so I could check that, but I believe it to be true). If I‚Äôm not mistaken it was a medical text for midwives and nurses.
But‚Ä¶that book showed me so much about the miracle of pregnancy and life. The changes from week to week. How a sperm and an egg merge and develop and next thing you know there‚Äôs a bouncing baby in the delivery room. It‚Äôs incredible how they develop week to week, especially in the first trimester where one week it‚Äôs nothing and then‚Ä¶a tiny little life. To think that all of us are here because of this very thing that seems so incredible is awe-inspiring.
That is a pretty spot on model. I had a missed miscarriage 2 years ago I found out at 12 weeks during my first ultrasound. During the medical management, the sac passed completely intact and you could see the baby. It looked like that, a very small baby not a 'clump of cells' as pro choicers would have people believe.
I am so sorry for your loss üíî
PCs still going to deny that's a person smh
But it's just a clump of cells /s
That‚Äôs a human being
I got a 10 week sonogram of my child 2 years ago. You could see fully formed limbs, body and head, including facial features. The sonogram technician showed me silicone models of the gestational weeks like the model you're showing. Absolutely amazing.
This is so sweet! I love this‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey that‚Äôs a pretty human-looking clump of cells right there!
Right!!! It‚Äôs straight up EVIL

Even if a fetus isn't a human, don't you think it is cruel to tear apart the body of an innocent living being? It's sad that animals have more protection on their right to life than an unborn baby.
Human is just genus Homo, therefore it would be a human fetus.
Vets routinely perform animal abortions. There‚Äôs no concept of a ‚Äúright to life‚Äù for other animals, except specific efforts to protect endangered species like turtle eggs or something.
Both are barbaric
Uh, excuse me! They‚Äôre a HEALTHCARE provider! Abortions are only a small part of what they do!
(95% of the services they provide are abortions.)
Seriously. It‚Äôs straight up evil.
Just wait until they learn that abortions affect non-human animals, too. It‚Äôs happened to 2 of our cats. They were to be spayed, and they were found to be pregnant. The veterinarian staff just continued with the procedures.
The first cat of ours that it happened to seemed depressed and then passed away. I‚Äôm not sure what happened with the second cat of ours, because she had been placed with a rescue organization by my parents, and then the organization had her spayed.
Because of these experiences, I created a petition to require ultrasounds before such procedures.
I've shared this a time or 2 but it's still relevant here:
When Roe V. Wade was overturned, I saw a celebrity post on Instagram a picture of a woman holding a protest sign that read: "Republican logic: Life begins at conception and ends at school shooting."
I ignored it for a while, and then I finally replied: "Pro-choice logic: Don't kill kids in school, just kill them before they are born."
Yikes! How did they take that?
Pro-choice is an irrational and incoherent worldview
facts. I had a long day with some MODERATE democrats today and im starting to understand why people think they are evil. One suggested to me that eradicating the human race was the best way for the world to continue on. Im aware not all democrats share that view but im not kidding when I say moderate democrats! They weren‚Äôt too far in!
It doesn‚Äôt even make sense how the democrats support abortion but claim guns are ‚Äúkilling kids‚Äù
Because they have convinced themselves that they don't have to care about the unborn.
So, they don't understand why we, who do care about the unborn, might not have exactly the same priorities that they do.
To us, the issues are equally bad, but more children die to abortion than to guns, and guns themselves are not used only for school shootings, they are also tools. Dangerous tools, but tools.
To them, only the kids killed in schools matter, because they don't care about the unborn.
The only real issue I have with this is what the OP posted in the tweet.
If restricting guns is going to be effective in stopping or reducing school shootings, then wouldn't it stand to reason that restricting abortions would have the same effect on abortions?
I'll just be honest here and say that I have no idea what the Democratic position is in any detail on gun control, but their rhetoric sounds like something you would say if you really wanted to ban guns, but couldn't do it in today's climate.
Now, I am 100% okay with background checks, parental responsibility, waiting periods and limited magazine sizes, so I am not sure what else they want.
The "assault-type" rifle ban is a pure ban on aesthetics and is hogwash. I don't see how that is going to do anything and has always made me think less of their position whenever it comes up.
Actual assault rifles which are full auto or select burst fire are already heavily restricted in the US and have been involved in exactly zero school shootings.
While I presume that the actual policy of the Democrats is not banning guns, I do have to wonder if they would be fine with the second amendment being removed.
Why does she have to tag all dems as pro choice? I feel like saying democrats gives pro choice republicans a pass.
To be fair, it's the Democratic Party's narrative.
No pro-choicers deserve a pass, but unless a Republican is with most Democrats on both abortion and gun control, this particular form of cognitive dissonance doesn't apply to them.
The first part always makes me chuckle. That is the whole point of banning abortion. Making it illegal would mean you could be prosecuted for it. The reverse could be said for people killing other people. Why ban intentional murder? They're just going to murder people illegally.
We at least will call the other side by the name they go by; pro-choice. They can‚Äôt even have a decent conscience calling us ‚Äúpro life‚Äù so they have to just choose the opposite of what they are, anti choice.
If our side did that, it would end pretty quickly. Imagine being called ‚Äúanti life‚Äù.
The obvious solution would be to call people "pro-abortion" and "anti-abortion", but they're against these objectively correct terms, I wonder why?
I'm anti-choice. Against the choice to kill innocent humans
They might try to insult us by calling us forced-birthers instead. It's sad that they think having to give birth is so horrible.
They fundamentally don't understand what birth is, birth is when the baby exits the womb. Abortion is birth, the only difference is that the baby is born dead.
Just throwing out there: r/prolifememes
Tell them that they are "ant-life" and they get outraged though....
We just love babies and want them to have the same rights we have. I love my 3 kids and would never change them for the world. Most females feel this way once they have kids. We need to bring back lifting up women for doing something we're really good at, having and raising kids.
Real! I'm also tired of the rhetoric that women can't have careers AND children. Like no girlies you absolutely can. Both can enrich your life.
No but like they are just brainwashed by like religion and stuff
You're so right queen! Religion also says not to murder, now that I think about it that's illogical!
Time to start an annual purge ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I feel like they want to gaslight us into thinking being pro-life is a misogynistic stance which can be easily be torn down like a crouton when you ask them 'well what if the unborn child is a girl why are you okay with killing them'
Exactly. Like if everyone is eager to talk about misogyny and the patriarchy, why don‚Äôt we talk about how most commonly in India and China, but all over the world, abortion is literally used as a tool for femicide. Or how abortion is an abuser‚Äôs best friend because it erases all evidence of incest, child abuse, rape, etc.
Like sorry that I‚Äôm on the side that is against killing MILLIONS of girls per year üôÑ
‚ÄúWell because they are just really really stupid and have been tricked by evil men! Or they are evil themselves!‚Äù
I‚Äôve had pro-choicers call me a misogynist, and then a minute later describe almost half of women in the US as stupid or evil.
Could this BE any more ironic?
I once went to a meeting of my college's Pro-Life student group. I was the only guy there.
I feel like the reason for this is because women like myself can pretty accurately affirm that "my body, my choice" is BOGUS because that baby has its own body and a right to life.
It's much easier to use the "you want to control women's bodies" argument on a man.
I went to a March for Life last year, and there was no shortage of men or women involved in the rally.
I wish we could have this without the need to vote for Trump.
I don't like Trump, but I can't vote for Harris so he's gonna get my vote
Same. I look at it like I‚Äôm really just voting for JD Vance lol
Frankly picking a Republican candidate was hard. I don't particularly love any of them. Trump is, unfortunately, the glue holding the party together right now. I'm voting for him a lot more reluctantly now than in 2020, but he's leagues ahead of Kamala at least.
THIS.
From a non-American pro-lifer
Not sure in what world I could sincerely call Trump "pro-life."
He just says whatever will get him power.
That may well be true, but if he does nothing at all to affect abortion for the next 4 years, that is VASTLY better than what Harris will do. All the hard PL work the past 50 years will have been for nothing.
I will be voting for Peter Sonski
This actually may be a good reason to vote for Trump.
It doesn‚Äôt matter what Trump personally thinks about the topic of abortion, as long as he is there we will maintain a conservative majority in the Supreme Court. I respect anyone who is bothered by Trump position and is hesitant to vote for him, but just be aware at what is at stake.
I find it disgusting, as someone who has dealt with SA, that victims of rape and abuse are only ever acknowledged when it‚Äôs to prove a political point. Stop it. We are people, not a gotcha point for pro abortion people to fling around
Facts, I was even told I must have not been raped. I even showed the stab wound and they said I probably did it to fight the abortion topic and real victims would want all rape babies dead.
This! Trauma should not be used for political purposes.
It is absolutely disgusting that they'll use a trauma as a reason. Victims of those deserve all our love and support throughout the whole situation.
People need to stop speaking for SA victims. It disgusts me too.
I always ask people who bring this up ‚ÄúHave you been raped and impregnated? How do you know what goes on inside the head of a woman who was? Why are you suggesting something that can destroy her mental health that much more? A forcefully impregnated woman needs therapy LONG BEFORE she considers abortion, but that‚Äôs the first thing you suggest? How disgusting of you to speak for a victim without letting them speak for themselves.‚Äù Then I send a bunch of different stories about women who birthed their babies conceived from rape (thanks LiveAction), and have amazing, loving lives with their children, then I put after that, ‚ÄúYou would rather a woman go through two traumatic experiences because of your political beliefs than actually live a healthy life after something horrible has happened. Congrats, you‚Äôre part of the problem.‚Äù ‚Ä¶. Something along those lines at least. Obviously it‚Äôs much different every time I type it, but I keep the same information and energy.
Never works though.
Also situations where pregnancy is life threatening to the mother is rarely detectable early on and is also not that common. Combined with SA I believe those reasons make up less than 5%. It truly is just murderous birth control.
It‚Äôs more like 30%. Another 30% is ‚Äùmy body, my choice‚Äù, ie, ‚Äùmy will be done, though it cost the lives of 70 million babies a year‚Äù. Yet another 30% is the ad misericordiam fallacy repeated ad nauseam. The final 10% consists of ‚ÄúIf you want to criminalize abortion, yOu WaNt To JaIl WoMeN fOr HaViNg MiScArRiAgEs‚Äù.
Had to look up what ad misericordium was. "Appeal to pity."
But they also do seem to have an unhealthy obsession with miscarriages. But that's a category error (I think). Both, unfortunately, result in the death of the unborn. Miscarriage: accident Abortion: deliberate
are you telling me there weren't 1,027,000 cases of rape and incest leading to pregnancy last year? Crazy talk
And yes, over one million in 2023.
Guys, this isn‚Äôt true.
‚ÄúFuck off, my body, my choice‚Äù is at least 90% of the shitty arguments
They hate it because they don't even realize that they hold Nazi views. They want to kill the "undesirables," often handicap people. Just like the Nazis did. Truth and accountability is like a kryptonite to them.
Same thing when abortion is compared to slavery because they want to play eternal victim and not be put in the same pool as people who dehumanize and view other humans as property
I fail to see how thats fear mongering. The bill board states only facts
We'll never know how many abortions have happened--these are just the ones reported voluntarily in one country over a specific period of time.
Scientific integrity would mandate reporting, but it wouldn't be enough to give a clear number.
Even if they were reported by clinics, ~7% of people seeking abortions in those clinics report trying to abort at home prior to their appointment.
There's no telling how many succeed in "home remedy" abortions, nor how many pregnant people are slipped abortion pills by partners or family members or exes.
the nazis utilized abortion against races they viewed as undesirable
It is showing how abortion is worse than the nazis. Abortion has killed more than hitler. Sad fact
Almost like we should be afraid of evil. Imagine going back to the 40s and someone puts up a sign that speaks only about Hitler. Would people say "Oh, the fear mongering!" in a mocking tone? No.
I actually like posts like that. Spreads the billboard---while the OP of that post and doubtless most of the comments are angry at the billboard, it's message might get through to someone.
Also, ironic that they call this fear-mongering when they call almost everybody they dislike a Nazi. In addition to calling everyone who votes for Trump a nazi, I'm seeing some of them now accusing Jews in general of being worse than nazis due to most Jews supporting Israel defending itself.
How is this fear mongering. It‚Äôs just straight up facts. Too bad the number they use for babies killed by abortion is so out of date.
The same folks that made the gas for the nazi gas chambers did make the abortion pill...


What‚Äôs even worse is the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a person‚Äù argument that comes after.
Yup! They say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs alive. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a human. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a person. I want to remove it and I have that right to self defence.‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Even worse than that is the fact that they‚Äôre using that line of reasoning on their own children
Same argument of racists and nazis
When someone tells me why pro-lifers make such a big deal about this issue and why we "want to control women's bodies" I tell them this exact thing.
For me abolishing abortion is the same as abolishing slavery. You telling me that I am not harmed by you harming and abusing your slave and he's yours by right because he's not a real person and how you'll be poor if we set him free doesn't mean how you treat him should be none of my business.
In this case it's a harmless and helpless baby which makes it twice as bad.
It‚Äôs similar sure, but it‚Äôs not equivalent. However, I do genuinely appreciate the concern, since it‚Äôs definitely a precarious moral territory.
It's like "Sure, the argument that some humans aren't persons has been shown to be on the wrong side of history every single time, but this time it's different!"
They think that granting the unborn personhood means that you remove personhood from women ( making them "incubators" or "livestock" instead) like sorry, you only get one personhood, so either you or the baby can have it, but not both. Gotta deny it to them so you don't lose out.. Doesn't occur to them, in their fear and anger, that mothers are indeed people too, after the act of bringing a whole new person into the world. Her personhood wasn't stripped away to be given to the child instead.
I remember the nazis thought of something like that about many people....
"abortion is akin to hiring a hitman to resolve a problem" - Pope Francis.
It literally is. And about $9400 cheaper

They're less common for sure, but part of the problem is that the pro-choice side refuses to make any distinction. They will use medical emergencies (which is much closer to being a reasonable excuse) as a justification in general. They will use rape, which is obviously rare, as an excuse in general. Most of their arguments justify abortion up to birth, so however rare it might be, they support it and need to be called out for that.
Because believing in equal rights for all human beings has always been the radical stance.
Isn't that so sad
Isn't our society thriving? This is progress! /s üôÑ
People 50 years ago: WE WILL HAVE FLYING CARS, FIND THE CURE FOR CANCER, COLONIZE OTHER PLANETS, BUILD INTELLIGENT ROBOTS IN 50 YEARS 2024: I identify as a cat mew. We don't need babies, babies bad. But... But human rights for everyone!
Even a lot of people who support abortion think third trimester is going too far, which it obviously is.
There‚Äôs plenty of pro choice ppl i have talked to that said they support a woman‚Äôs choice at any stage in pregnancy as long as its in her body.
But post birth abortion is totally illegal guys! Please ignore us while we attempt to change that...
I don‚Äôt believe the abortion crowd when they say once the child is born it‚Äôs sacred and is recognized as a person. These people have spent decades pushing the line in the sand and are trying to gaslight us into thinking that ‚Äúpost-birth abortions‚Äù will never be a thing.
Truly horrible legislation
The democratic ticket is evil
ABC did a horrendous job in this debate, unsurprisingly.
I thought Trump was bullshitting but‚Ä¶ why am I not surprised.
It doesnt take much digging‚Ä¶.this was reported on when she picked him.
But pro-choicers told me literal infanticide wasnt actually happening. Its a myth!!
Truly the arbortion issue would not exist if planned parenthood types didnt censor accurate information
cuz he wanted to hide it... at least EIGHT babies died post-birth
That is disgusting.
I have never listened to her willingly.
Does that mean pro-life non-Americans can still listen to her music? üá®üá¶
But in all seriousness, I don't know why celebrities demand that people with certain beliefs and values stay away from their art. For such a leftist bunch that is "accepting" of diversity, they certainty don't appreciate diversity of thought.
They kinda do though. They‚Äôll make a big fuss and act all entitled because they‚Äôre Better Than Us, obviously, but they‚Äôre not gonna turn away our money. They just say these things because most normal people don‚Äôt care what out of touch celebrities tell us to do.
"LA told me, you'll be a pop star. All you have to change is everything you are."
I will never understand women like her. Here's what she said in a 2019 interview:
How can you feel bad about a miscarriage but at the same time support women who, for all intents and purposes, induce one?
Because they don't feel bad about the miscarriage on behalf of an existing unborn child who died. They feel bad about missing out on a potential child, or even just the potential life-path they were imagining for themself as a mother. She seems more bothered by body insecurities (which is totally valid) than by wanting a child.
It's a deal.
She‚Äôs not the only artist I‚Äôve already removed from my Spotify playlists!
Demi Lovato, Billie Eilish, John Legend, Olivia Rodrigo (never liked her), basically any white younger woman singer etc....
Not my fault that her Corny ass music plays on the radio, when I'm listening to it.
