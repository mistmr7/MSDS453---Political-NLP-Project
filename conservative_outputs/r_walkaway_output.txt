Your sexual orientation is not your personality either.
Nor is it an accomplishment.
But is it a reason to hire you?
Preach!
I’ve thought this for a long time. Be whoever you want to be but don’t force anyone to participate.
Precisely.
Seriously.
I used to view the world with a libertarian mindset like this. But honestly they have pushed so hard that I simply want all degeneracy gone now.
Damn OP
Really triggered the globohomos with this one
Your post is getting brigaded by hardcore alphabet folk









Technically she didnt lose they taxpayer money......she knows exactly who and where it went.
I mean, they passed the $300 billion Inflation 'Reduction' Act which they admitted had nothing to do with inflation. That money came from taxpayers and simple economics tells me that $300 billon in government spending is going to increase inflation not lower it. This negatively impacted the average American. Not sure how Trump's personal financial situation did. The Inflation 'Reduction' Act is just one example of many when it comes to the Democrats.
That left a BIG mark!
I just watched a Caleb Hammer video where a pink haired girl came into $600k from a divorce and pretty much blew the money in two years. After watching that video I read an article on how a 40 year old woman inherited $350k from her grandma and blew through that money in a year on nothing.
The fact Trump took the money his father gave him and grew it into a billion dollar real estate empire is amazing and shouldn’t be taken lightly just because he had a few failures. There are countless stories about young rich people who were born into wealth and when it came time to take over they ended up broke.
Gotta love freedomtoons
Ouch, the truth hurts!
One of the dumbest talking points ever by the left. 6 of the 500 plus successful llc’s trump has filed bankruptcy = failed businessman to these brainwashed people who don’t know how business works and have never created anything.
If this was reversed it would be top upvoted on clevercomebacks. Instead if you do post this on there you'll be banned for hate speech!
BRB, gonna post it









I’m literally like a 2008 democrat and they consider me far right
Yup. I always just consider myself a normal person from 20 years ago. I just hold views that Obama publicly held in 2006. I hold views that Joe Biden openly held, and the DNC openly held, not that long ago. And people still don't acknowledge the movement in the extremist, radical direction that has taken place. It's unsettling.
The goalposts moved to China, as well-funded Marxism took over the left in MANY western countries. According to plan
Trump is a New York Democrat and they consider him a Nazi. The “right wing” in this country doesn’t exist lol
Just imagine 2030 and beyond. You vill eat ze bugs. You vill not use cash. You vill own nothing and feel crappy. 8 years of Cackles will be the final act of fully lobotomizing the average American. And the younger generations will cheerlead it on.
You kidding? This wasn't controversial ten years ago. It wasn't until Trump ran that the Democrats flipped their position on this - specifically so they could accuse Trump of being racist for wanting it.
There was a time Democrats were saying Republicans wanted illegal immigrants because it was cheap labor even.
My how things change
Now do gay marriage









Always has been.
Dang it. I upvoted this. Am I going to jail now?
Maybe, but atleast you will be in better company than outside of it
Yes, you committed a hate crime
Brigaders hitting every post today. Weirdos.
I saw a video yesterday, don't know from where, but it looked like an 8-10 year old British girl who had been hacked across her back with a machete. She had been hit so hard with the machete that when you looked at the wound you could see her lungs moving inside of her body, ribs were cut right off her spine.
You tell me, who should be angry that attacks like that are happening? Who should be punished for that?
Uh no one should be punished it's their culture, quit being a pig and respect their rights /s in case it wasn't obvious
As a patriotic conservative from Poland I can say that: LET ME OUT OF THIS SHITTY ORGANIZATION AND PLEASE ELECT TRUMP I DON'T WANNA BE USED AS A PROXY COMBATANT





The little poses she does when naming each of her accolades is probably the most annoying part
Was looking for this comment to upvote. Thanks. The little feigned humility dance is so annoying, it’s like she’s still 12 years old.
Plus, you just KNOW she ranks herself #1 in the group, but is afraid of being perceived as the obvious narcissist that she is.
'I ranked him low because I think he's judging IQ based on his individual perception, not looking at the whole picture', as she then proceeds to judge IQ completely and solely by her own perspective and gets kicked in the teeth by reality at the end.
No this genius has convinced herself that everyone agrees with her, so she must be right, and the people with fewer accolades are just lesser and can't see the big picture like her. Probably rationalized her low score as the test being rigged.
I would not brag about shitty c19 tests
I also love the implication that making COVID tests requires her to be intelligent. The most likely answer is it was developed by someone else with decades of experience and then passed off to her.
No one short of a literal savant is developing a novel vaccine at 30 years old.
I don’t want to pretend like I have a massive IQ or anything, but it was pretty clear in university I was smarter than the average person there.
Anyone that is actually intelligent and has an ounce of humility knows that getting a degree does not mean you are more intelligent than other people. It could, but usually it means you either worked hard, got a bullshit degree, went to an easy school, or (lately) that you fill a checkbox or had the right politics.
It’s a lot more common these days to be educated beyond your intellect.
I think that a sign of intelligence is not talking about how intelligent you are, maybe not even realizing it.









That’s not just a burn, that’s a full on charring
That was some Sharon Weiss stuff.
That’s weird, because JFK would not be welcome in today’s Democrat party. I don’t know much about RFK, but it’s probably the same.
Democrats would call 1999 Bill Clinton a fascist.
JFK would literally be worse than Trump in their eyes today.
JFK. Greatest Generation. “Ask what you can do for your country.”
Wow, that’s nasty burn
Mia just got destroyed.
Mia, I knew Robert Kennedy. I worked with Robert Kennedy. Robert Kennedy was a friend of mine.
Mia, you’re no Robert Kennedy.









It’s hilarious how these news conglomerates are trying to preempt that it’s gonna take a long time to count the votes. It’s like the start of 1984 happening. They think we will just accept that it’s normal and forget that voting used to be finished by midnight and there was always a clear winner in every state.
I apologize on behalf of Pennsylvania
Amazing how even NYC which has a population of over 8 million miraculously gets their counts done before these clowns in Fulton and Broward County. Seriously, is there somewhere we can bet they'll be the last counties in the nation to finish their counts? It's easy money
Traitors are shot, no?
Shhhh! Someone may read that comment and report it as "a call to violence."
Unfortunately, in my state of Oregon, the law now states that mail in ballots (OR has been 100% vote-by-mail for over 20 years) must only be POSTMARKED on Election Day. It used to be that it had to be mailed soon enough to be at the election office by Election Day but they recently changed that. Of course that opens up an avenue for fraud since ballots can arrive 2 days after Election Day so it will take even more time to count them as they have a plausible reason for ballots being counted AFTER Election Day.
DO NOT LET YOUR STATE GO 100% VOTE-BY-MAIL - it's a trap. Oregon has not had a Republican Governor since before it went vote-by-mail and Democrats have, at times, had a SUPER-majority in the legislature.
Isn't this because Florida allows counting of mail-in votes before Election Day, but most other red and purple states outlaw it until polls are closed?
Yes, Florida also requires your ballot to be received by the election deadline. Other states allow mail in ballots that were postmarked by election day and in some cases we saw in 2020 they just accepted anything that came in no matter what the postmark was or if it had any at all.
Technology has benefited everything but voting? How do we advance so quickly but can't create a voting system that allows us to call an election same day. It's bullshit gamesmanship to cheat, plain and simple.









Also, receiving down payment assistance disqualifies home buyers from refinancing, because it puts a lien on their home. Have fun being stuck with your 7% interest rate
Trump pays for some groceries out of his pocket and they lose their inds saying he's trying to buy votes
Kamala says she will give people $25k out of tax payers pockets (which means it will cost us $35k+ for everyone to pay for it) and that gets praised....
The left everyone....
Do you want inflation. Because that’s how you get inflation. And then a bubble. Because all those people you gifted $25,000 to for a downpayment won’t be able to afford the property tax their first year.
They don’t get it. The solution to everything for them is to throw government money at something aka tax payer money. Then do stupid shit like call inflation transitory, play the class warfare propaganda games, and blame all the evil rich people and corporations aka EMPLOYERS OF EVERYONE for rampant inflation.
Who said anything about affordability? I'm trying to bribe people.
If you can’t afford 25k for a down payment how are you going to afford the yearly unrealized gain tax when your home increases value?
Democrats are terrible at Economics. Kamala is more terrible than the average Democrat.
They don't care about economics because it doesn't affect them.   Someone else will pay for their policies.
Zero people will see that $25,000.
First, its a tax credit. You must earn enough income to owe and pay taxes to get money back in a tax credit.
Second, you must be a first generation home owner. Your parents/family owns a home, you wont qualify.
Third, you need to buy a home, mortgage accepted etc, to then claim the tax credit.
This is tax credit for the wealthy that can afford the current home values and interest rates.
Good luck folks!




“Rest in power” always sounded goofy to me.
Sounds so childish.
He committed the original sin of being white. The woke church would never fully accept him.
He only killed himself?
That makes it the least successful Pro-Palestine suicide in recorded history.
How sad.  The people he was trying to impress are embarrassed of him.
"historically" as if it's been a thing people say for more than 3 years
That phrase was 100% invented on twitter
Silly, don't you know real history started in 2011?
Everything before that was an evil time where people didn't know how to be good, and therefore has no impact on today.
“Alrighty troops. I never thought I’d have to include this in the safety brief, but for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT SET YOURSELVES ON FIRE. And especially do not do so in uniform as an act of political protest. If you survive, You WILL be held accountable”









Reporter: "Are you planning to stop calling Trump a threat to the nation after seeing the violence it incites?"
White house: "It is extremely dangerous and a threat to our nation when you say our rhetoric is inciting violence. And no we will not stop. Trump is an existential threat to democracy and our way of life, we must stop at nothing to prevent him from being elected. If Trump wants to avoid these assassinations, he can easily just drop out of the race."
'Donald Trump can stop inciting violence by responding to our incitement to violence whenever he wants! '
Crazies being whipped into a frenzy by Hitler/Nazi analogies. Trump is a LOT of things… Adolf Hitler isn’t one of them. #OpenaHistoryBook
The Nazi Left are smarter nowadays. See, you don't have to burn books, as long as you rewrite them all beforehand. The undesirable titles just get thrown away by the libraries and school admins.
And then you can always distract the masses by filling the information highways with much more blatantly edited sparkly digital disinformation than they'd ever be able to find on their own in physical books.
Work smarter not harder!
Fun fact: Here in Brazil, you call someone a "donkey" when you wanna say they're dumb.
It’s the same in America
It’s always (d)ifferent
And we have Harris saying that they can't let Trump have the microphone again.
She’s absolutely reich





Wonder what the common denominator is with this rampant crime?
We need open carry out here immediately.
Must be Donald trumps fault. That much patriotism can’t be good for ya.
Where are the pu$$ies from the politics sub who ban all the truth now? This is their base, in their preferred state, committing crimes unchecked.
Oh this was no accident.
Your right. Apparently the crew were yelling out, "where are the jewels?!"
This was definitely planned
The dude filming is brave af. I'm surprised nobody shot him.
Simple armed robbery they won't be charged even if caught. Murder, well that one they might actually get charged for
If only they would defund the police.









I love this guy because he is so perfectly forgettable. Harris will lose, and we’ll never hear another word about Walz. Just like Tim Kaine
God, I hope you're right.
But I fear the worse...
I don't know he is the Dem's mascot, Kamala just screw up! The Dems gonna advertise Walz doing some photo-op.
Reddit barely advertise Kamala only they defend her.
Most of their political ads involve Walz doing something, now Zelensky, attacking Trump and attacking JD Vance.
Dems doesn't even care about Kamala they always vote blue no matter what.
I don't understand him. I hear way more about him than Kamala. It's funny, they say Harris had no power as VP, yet when she is going to be President they spend all their time talking about her VP.
Reports on this post so far:
Their plan is to raise corporate taxes and lower prices. Really raising taxes will only raise prices that is how stupid they are
Every time these (both!) VP candidates talk, its like they are in a battle to make sure they do not get elected..
The sad thing is, none of their supporters will notice. And defend it and say that the "this" here is trump....somehow.









Good thing we can eat vibes and joy, amirite
Scary because it is close to reality.
Hahaha this is scary but funny
I think you confused a few people with this one. Lol

This phrase is only slightly more stupid than “I don’t know what that means”
Blaming high food prices on "price gouging" and "greedflation" instead of admitting that inflation and poor fiscal policy has caused this. Then promising price controls to tackle this make believe greedflation.
Price controls, Kamala Harris' proposed remedy for this problem, have almost always lead to food shortages.
Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls How Not to Fight Inflation









This would be front page of Reddit if it were the other way around. 🤣
Literally what I thought. If Barron trump, Melania and Ivanka posted themselves wearing Harris / Walz shirts it would break the internet and the media wouldn’t stfu about it
I knew his brother was openly opposed, but did his entire family really go as far as to make T-shirts? That’s savage 😂
This is kinda sad. When your own family is voting for the other guy
Cryzinger’s family hates him too
Respectfully, I do not give a fiddler’s f@&k what Lara Trump, RFK’s family, and these people think about the political landscape.
Walz’s collectivist communist leaning ideology is more than enough for me to know he is trash.
THANK YOU it is so refreshing to see someone else say it. Supporting people based on the beliefs of others, of believed popularity or not, and not based on the policies and beliefs of the person they are supporting is actual garbage. Voting along party lines and not policy is why this country is going in the shitter.
Walz is a filthy communist, not because "someone said he was", but because if you look at his actions and policies, you know he revels in socialistic unrest and has a weird interest in children and horse cock. I'm good, bro.
Curious, what or where is the original reference for this photo, and is this actually walzes family or just a family with the same last name? TIA
Walz's what?





Hate speech is defined as opposing the state’s agenda and narrative.
That's a good definition. Reporting you to authorities.
So fascism
Add Ireland to the list of countries I will never set foot in.
there are only a few places left in the world with a chance to stop this, but if individual liberty is extinguished everywhere there will be no going back given technological capabilities. The US is still a place with a fighting chance, but so many here are welcoming it with open arms. dystopian hellscape here we come!
It’s going down FAST here in the US.
It's turning into a shithole of a country.
This is what Biden and his supporters want here in the states
1984 was an instruction manual, be careful not to committ thoughtcrime





Was the guy with the pepper spray spraying his own people?
I think he got more of his own than the other guys.
I think he got himself while trying to find instructions on the bottle on how to turn it off...
They have no adrenaline control, so they panic during confrontations.
Wasn't even a closed fist and he went down
Lol weight classes matter. Dudes arm weighed as much as lil dudes leg.
Justice.
It warms the soul.
Scenes like this warm my black heart. Messing with angry dads who actually work for a living when you can't even bench the 45" bar is a real bad idea.
It ended exactly the same way down in Glendale when they messed with the Armenian community.
I went to find a link to the video, and unsurprisingly I can't find it. Page after page of links and every one is a news station or official source.
All of the footage from protestors who were there has been removed from search, or at least pushed down so far you can't find it in 5 pages.
Iove how antifa boys can't fight and have to resort to pepper spray like little bishis.
Puzzies
And then pepper sprays his own “comrades”. Can’t make this shit up lmao









Before yesterday, when I listened to the full speech of his endorsement of Trump, I had no idea what an eloquent speaker he was. And he has a good grasp of the major issues that are important to him.
He speaks of the issues better than either candidate tbh. Practical issues: war, foreign aid, health crisis, cost of living, etc.
He is genuinely one of the more intelligent & experienced politicians in the mix nowadays. The fact the current D party attacks & shuns him should speak volumes to independents & anyone on the fence.
But MAGA=Trump=bad. 
 In true spirit of OP's post, and well worth the listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4i3LmR0K74
Leading the world in innovation, productivity and technology.. THIS IS IT! We want an excellent America!
He didn’t walk away he went full Usain Bolt away from the Dems. Good for him!!
He unlocked the door. He figured it out.
Now surely, RFK as. Democrat who supports Trump will be treated as reverently as those Republicans who are supporting Harris, right? No? Interesting, that double standard. When Republicans turn against their own party, the Left will happily praise them - look no further than the Left giving Bush Jr. and even Dick Cheney himself a “revisionist history rebrand” the past few years - because they denounced Trump. That is unbelievable, that those men who were once “the next Hitler,” in their day, became tolerable to liberals on that alone.
Yet little to no credence is given when Democrats turn on their own party. Oh, Andrew Yang just has sour grapes. Oh, Tulsi Gabbard is just a Russian asset. RFK Jr. just wants money and influence. There is a huge double standard at play with this.









Anyone who’s blaming “corporate greed” is smooth brained. Corporations have always been 10/10 greedy since the concept of money was invented.
Yeah? And somehow they aren’t raising prices ?
X Marx the spot, Comrade!
I'm amazed they are still talking about it. Good god.
I like how the lefties lost their Russia boner now that Russia has finally ridden itself if it’s communist past.  American lefties doing this “hey fellow American patriots, we sure do still hate Russia! Cold War, amiright?” 
 They’re mad Russia threw off its leftist shackles and returned to the values of its traditional Eastern Orthodox Christian past.  They view Russia as traitors and apostates to “progress.”




Honestly, I'm surprised that turned out the way it did. The guy must not have been very important for his media allies to just up and abandon him like that.
Democrats don’t have a shortage of useful idiots, and they can easily hire another starving communications major.
Even big names like Chris Cuomo- as soon as he no longer was the governor’s brother, they got rid of him.
They can always just hire a new propaganda spewing activist. These people are disposable.
The 'useful idiots' have always been the 2nd group in front of the firing squad.
It’s so nice to see great news like this every once in awhile
Go woke go broke? More than every once in a while.
It's happening on a weekly basis now. It's pretty much every-other-day-now that news comes out about DEI departments getting shut down, trans athletes being banned from various sports, or some company getting humiliated online for "woke" advertising.
The tide has turned. Wokism is no longer in their favor, no matter how much they desperately cling on to it.
Good. More people who try to burn people's lives down like this need to have their own lives burned down.
Learn to code.

If having the cops called on you is endangering your life, maybe you shouldn’t do things that would cause someone to call the cops on you.
Woah! You just blew my mind!
Consequences for degenerate behavior? Say it ain’t so!
Okay, but here's a radical concept: What if I simply want to promote a culture where criminal activity is not tolerated in my community? That's in my personal interest, don't you think?
She's an idiot all around. If CVS loses enough merchandise they'll close that store, meaning that guy is probably out of a job. It's in his best interest to keep theft to a minimum.
An old video and she cuts the video because the two “black folks” start sticking up for him and she gets so mad she storms out.
Imagine being duped by old white liberal broads into thinking being legally allowed to steal is in the best interest of your people.
I don't understand this logic. These people are so easy to program.

You have to love this man! Balls of steel.
Not going to lie, this made me bust out laughing. He is gangster.
Not even a huge fan of Trump either, but this is funny.
Also, it's kinda sad this is the world we live in, and I'm not sure what it says about our country on a deeper level. But I'm not going to worry about that. Because I want to laugh.
Isn't it a little convenient that the ABC affidavit dropped and then a couple hours later someone tried to shoot Trump? Almost like it's coordinated...
Didn’t the house vote on a bill earlier this year to take away trump’s secret service privileges and a bunch of democrats voted for it?
Lmaoooo what a fucking legend
hahaha!!! i love him ❤️
How can you not like the guy, fucking gangster.
Hahaha. After the first shooting attempt I thought he was gonna say something like "you're gonna have to do better than that!"









Wow. Shit just got real.
Given the fact that the FBI agent in charge is an avid Trump hater and was in charge of the raid on Maralago, Desantis is right in not turning him over..he knows what will happen if he does.
Seriously?!
He'll get the Hillary Clinton or Epstein treatment before he can really talk.
Don't let them Epstein him . . .
Attempted murder is still a state and local crime so it should be investigated by FDLE.
section 879 of Title 18 makes it different because he is a former president. But yes, keep him far from where he can get Hillary'd.
Desantis is so based
Not gonna let you sweep this one under the fucking rug




"You're an extremist!"

There's a reason the Imperium forbids AI. It may get a lot of things wrong, but in this regard, I think it's right on the money.
I got it to admit that historically 98% of people in Germany were white in the late 19th century and it generated pictures of a white family for me under that context. But it still gave me a page-long lecture on the importance of diversity when it did so.
And AI is the future.
Fun times ahead...
Open ai and Google getting dragged for dei wokeness is the highlight of the last two days for me
Some of the technology using lefties are actually waking up very slightly
Fuck Google.
Google AI is worthless. Wouldn't tell me powerball numbers or which stock pelosi was buying.
This is what scares me about AI. It’s programmed to tow the narrative.









What I don't understand is that we recently had a tragic school shooting in Georgia, and the dems are saying if we elect Kamala she'll prevent this. But she's already in office rn, with Biden. Wtf have they been doing these past four years? You expect me to believe that they'll suddenly fix school shootings now? What were they waiting for?
Truth. Such gaslighting!
And every one of them started unnecessary wars. 
is bush also team kamala?
Hey, remember all 8 years when Bush Jr. was in office, and the media, music industry, Hollywood, etc. made an absolute mockery of him every chance they got? Now he's part of their club.
He's pretty anti trump, so I believe it. He's also buddies with the Obamas.
So is Dick Cheney, lol.
His VP seems to be.
Gee it almost seems like they hate him because he won’t fall in line and be like them.









Their hate for Elon rising to new heights, they absolutely hate that they can’t censor him
That’s one of the things I love.
The puffed up bullshit balloon is impressive, this is the power of money and the media. It really is so obvious.
"I dOn'T sEE anY bIAs!"
Hmm.. people still read “Time”?! 😂
When Carter was chosen in 1976, hardly anyone outside Georgia knew who he was. Democrats media allies did an all-out PR push for him, including putting him on TIME magazine cover 3 times. They even did a hand painted cover like this, and tried to make him look as much like Kennedy as possible. Shit never changes.
lol
I mean sheeps are biased therefore they dont see the bias
Two months later: I can't believe they ate the whole thing.




That's my 🍊 man, The Don.
The Teflon Don
MSDNC: Trump holds rally in rural nebraska and only 8 people show up, does this mean Biden will win Nebraska!?!
CNN: Is it time to boycott John Deer's after Trump is signs one?
MSNPC: Trump vandalizes a tractor in rural Nebraska. Are tractors racist?
Right, meanwhile Biden holds a rally in Chicago and only 8 people show up. Obviously he’s on his way to get the most votes in American history.
That’s awesome. I hope the owner clear coats that signature.
I have a pic of the brick he signed at Camp Bonifas at the JSA.
There’s a reason he is a folk hero to people
Let's just hope there's enough of them voting.









I love how all the main subs are like "putin is a liar, this is obviously 4d chess, this is clearly a tactic to make trump look better" but when putin endorsed trump previously it was proof he was a russian agent.
Also all the main news is saying that this was a "joke" and a "troll", even though he said he doesnt want trump in because trump is harder with sanctions and economic pressure.
Like seriously, google "putin endorse" and look at how every headline is just "mocking/joking/trolling/suggesting" Like yeah, hes joking, but watch the interview, he hates america, hes picking the lesser of two evils. Hes citing the longshot that maybe harris wont be as bad as trump can be as the reason for his decision. He is joking, but not about who he is backing
He is playing 4D chess. He knows the US media will say he's doing it to try to tank Harris cause he really wants Trump. Ironically he really does want Kamala to win. Trump wasn't afraid to spank our adversaries when they got uppity, him included. Putin doesn't want Trump, he wants a weak kneed Dem for another 4 years.
Is it any coincidence he decided to invade Ukraine a mere 7 months after Biden's disastrous Afghanistan pullout, which clearly demonstrated the current administration's weakness and ineptitude on foreign policy?
Is it any coincidence he has invaded a country under 3 out of the last 4 administrations? Wonder which one he stayed in line under... I'm sure he just didn't feel like invading Ukraine back then.
Meanwhile, China is eating the West for lunch.
It’s called projecting, people do it all the time but Dems do projecting on crack (especially Hunter!)
Putin's goal has always been to sow division among Americans. Judging by how thoroughly one of our two parties has taken his bait, he, and that party, have done more damage than he could ever do by simply helping elect one candidate over another.
I’ve already seen a bunch of people say it’s Russian “reverse psychology”, or they say that he is joking. We all know if he said that he supported Trump we would get nonstop articles and breaking news coverage every hour.
Especially when you realize all the people saying this are CCP agents
Dems can't hide it anymore lmao
Lol so many people running damage control
