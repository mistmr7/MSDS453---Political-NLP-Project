Love it! lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
This might be the funniest thing i‚Äôve seen in 2024 so far
Now this in an entrepreneur
Love this guys hustle. That‚Äôs actually a great idea!
Everything was fine until the last second. I don't know what exactly he was doing there, but it looked like he was trying to take the phone from her or something.
Hiring someone to complain to other people? Great idea for all the non-confrontational people. Being physically confrontational? That's no good. I'm not okay with that.
It's staged, meng.
I would like this subreddit to be nothing but watching eccentric business ideas play out in the wild.
Funny video and funny joke. But this subreddit is called r/capitalism and not r/businessideas.
thank god for capitalism.
Capitalism advocates really need to start saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not real capitalism‚Äù
Start calling it what it really is "economic freedom".
Because it's easier if everybody else does.
The free trade of goods and services is exactly why humans have become so successful at surviving.
It is blamed by people who fundamentally don't even know the definition of capitalism. They just see Big Business making big money and then compare it to themselves (who can't possibly compete on the same level), forgetting that one needs skills and a gap in a market to run a successful business.
They also misunderstand profit as a bad thing. Profit is a sign of success. Any business has an incentive to succeed. Shareholders and investors need to be kept happy, because they've invested their own resources into a company.
They see profit as a sign of a "failure of the system" essentially to protect themselves.
I blame socialism and Marx's modern proponents for this. Nothing in life is free. Nothing in life has ever been free.
Very well put.
Public education does a poor job of teaching basic economics. Most people can‚Äôt tell you the difference between free market capitalism and crony capitalism.
Exactly this. Government funded education never teaches students to criticize the current government regime. And this rule doesn't only apply to the United States.
Does anyone think government funded schools in China, India, Venezuela, etc., teach students to criticize government meddling in the economy? Of course not! American students are just as brainwashed about government meddling in the economy as Chinese students or Indian students.
Because Reddit is chock-full of brainwashed millennials and Gen-z kids who are in the midwit IQ range of about 105-115. Most of them went to college, so they think they're smarter than they actually are and they managed to absorb the left-wing talking points of their professors.
On top of that, Reddit people tend to read left-wing news sources (CNN, Time, MSNBC, NY Times) and think they're legitimate sources of information. I would guarantee that 95% of Reddit would not be able to even define what "capitalism" or "free markets" really are about. It would just be some nonsense about how Europe has socialized medicine, so why can't we??
Because they want other people to pay for them to do nothing.
Easier than looking in a mirror.
An absolute fact is that life isn‚Äôt fair, and we live in an imperfect world. To add to that, people are also imperfect, and people can be greedy, selfish, and evil. No system of governance will erase those facts.
A lot of people on Reddit blame capitalism for their bad lot in life. It‚Äôs easy for them to blame others for their problems and be jealous and bitter over the (deserved or undeserved) success of others. While that‚Äôs easy, it also does nothing to change their situation. What‚Äôs not easy is taking personal responsibility, making good decisions, figuring out what skills they enjoy and how to use those to provide value to others, and most importantly taking risk. So instead of doing what‚Äôs hard, they advocate for a nanny state where they don‚Äôt have to do any of that, and no one can be better off than them, and they can sit in their comfort zone till they end their days and return back to the earth.
The beauty of capitalism is that it makes the best of the bad situation. It weaponizes peoples greed and selfishness. If you want to survive and be successful you must do something for others. Something others find value-able. No other free system of governance turns greed and selfishness into altruism like capitalism. No other system of governance enables people from any walk of life the opportunity to be as successful or more, than people who had a better start. It‚Äôs just not handed to you, you have to work for it.
Is capitalism perfect? No, but it‚Äôs better than all the rest.
I highly recommend watching Milton Friedman‚Äôs Free to Choose Series
So refreshing to go back to first principles.
Correct
Finally a world leader who is openly for free markets
I‚Äôm pissed. Just going back for my masters in insect appendage research.
Studying legs on flies is how we discovered genetics, and do a lot of it today. The genetic technology which is currently at 1986 in computer terms and is slowing becoming the biggest field of of diagnostic understanding and treatment of many diseases.
But he is correct that if you ask people what they want they will choose a pretty wife than a cure for cancer, until they it becomes a real thing for them and a real possibility to stop it.

Excellent comment üëç
I see what you did there üòÜ
My favorite question is: "can you name a non-capitalist country that's thriving?"
Yeah I mean I think communism was more or less dead on arrival in an economic sense. But the fundamental human emotions that drive the ideology won't disappear, and we're already seeing (since the 60's) communism evolving into other stuff with the same oppressor-oppressed narrative.
That economic model was dead when stalin had to shoot people to make them hand over their silver coins.
It's not dead. For as long as people advocate for it, the idea stays alive. What's more dangerous is that modern proponents don't say anything about the famines, the death and the destruction of morality.
But all the bad from the past wasn't real Communism! True Communism simply hasn't been tried yet. We'll get it right eventually!
You know that's what the Commies will say.
Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon ---- Friedman
Yes, but reality already proved the left wing economic establishment wrong decades ago.
It appears we need repeated examples every generation.
They're all in full force on Reddit and Twitter. Keynesian and socialist politics are front and center.
Socialism: Inflation inflation everywhere and not a crumb to eat.
Remember when China liberalized ownership of businesses in the 90s, and GDP grew from $47billion to $18trillion by 2021. (400X growth) Even a Little capitalism goes a long way.
Argentina's inflation rate was over 200% as of a couple months ago, with more than a 50% poverty rate.
Yeah, what a utopia that the "left-wing economic establishment" is hiding from us.
Pretty sure Milei inherited that from the Peronist Nazis. His actions have brought economic prosperity with an economic surplus that hasn't happened for 12 years under the Peronists. Inflation and poverty won't see immediate effects admittedly.
Argentina is a highly corrupt country with broken politics and a trashed financial system. It's proven nothing other than that the old regime was completely inept.
A hard change on reigning in corruption and inflationary factors could be taken from a few different economic methods. A libertarian approach might be more painful than some others, but it's possibly all their government is capable of due to entrenched corruption.
I think you know why. You just want confirmation. Yes, you are correct.
Because socialism cannot stand up to open debate
I got banned from r/communism101 for literally asking this:
Why is Russia and China considered "communist" under Stalin and Mao? I know an intermediate amount of these subjects. I just don't understand why they are considered communist when they still have a government? I thought communism is supposed to get rid of the government entity when following communism? Wouldn't they be called socialist? I really have no idea? I'm not a communist or support the philosophy. I'm not here to argue it's just an actual question. If I reply a question it's not throw shade or looking to argue it's just l'd like to know the response! Thank you!
I know socialism and communism are different but still basically the same. Can‚Äôt believe they banned me for this. Lol.
you think thats bad, i was banned from socialism for saying "war crimes are bad"
they claimed i violated a rule they made 2 weeks later, which i still hadnt violated. after a while id ask why they banned and they wouldnt even respond, just mute me temporarily.
they don't just reinforce an economic theory echo chamber. if you disagree on any issue theyll purge you.
the best subreddit for socialists and curious non socialists is capitalism v socialism. thats just an open book of knowledge and debate. love it.
Don't ask them that question.
Because we have a logical leg to stand on in an argument instead of just emotional appeals.
Socialism cannot stand criticism or divergent opinion.
‚ÄúThe issue is not the issue. The issue is revolution.‚Äù -James Lindsay
Because socialists are free to be socialists within the bounds of a capitalist society, but capitalists are not free to be capitalists within a socialist society. Socialism as a state institution requires authoritarianism to support it while capitalism is an organic framework that develops naturally.
Religions have to protect their irrational beliefs from outsiders.
Well that‚Äôs not deeply authoritarian at all /s
It's in their nature
Turning the TV/radio on uses too much energy.

Ah, I see they want to compete with Japan to lose their status on "world's third largest economy".
This is all just a vehicle to exert control over the people. Get people conditioned to being told how to live by the state.
Bow to your new god - Gaia, the Mother Earth.
Did anyone even read the article? He is not proposing them.
Germany is not nor has ever been part of the Free World. A free country wouldn‚Äôt remotely tolerate government officials seriously threatening something like this.

finally, actual capitalism content on this sub
Nothing else matters if you can not be economically free.
Great post thanks for sharing

Ole ole Maggie‚Äôs dead dead dead. One of the worst pieces of scum to ever walk the earth. Justice for the 97
You wanna add some context here?
You just described yourself.
Shut up commie
It‚Äôs a vague word which makes it easy to blame for anything
It is not vague at all. People deliberately twist it.
I assume people hate capitalism because they don't have capital.
There's side benefits like access to grocery stores and consumer goods, but "X lives better then y" is still going to turn people off even if Y has it pretty good.
You can talk about how a farm is worth a million dollars, but probably don't see how expensive it is to actually run the farm and keep equipment repaired, employees paid, animals fed, and crops grown, ignoring the possibility of disease or drought (or farther north, damage/financial risk from cold weather or snow storms)
Plus there's people who see labor as exploitive, despite not all labor being valuable in the same way.
If everybody can do their own electrical work with ease, electricians are pointless.
A football team is valuable up until the players get injured or retire, but a good coach that can create multiple good teams is going to be more valuable over time.
Also I think people conflate net worth with cash assets. Net worth is just what people think you're worth when accounting for how much property you own, the cash on hand, and investments, but it doesn't necessarily mean you can spend that much. Converting things that are worth money into money takes longer and doesn't mean you'll get exact value.
In my experience, I can think of 3 individuals who openly identify as ‚Äúanti-capitalists‚Äù and they are all struggling financially but also college-educated.. aka they don‚Äôt have capital. All 3 are quite intelligent yet poor
They‚Äôre conflating capitalism with technofeudalism, bureaucracy, and/or civilization.
Because it has downsides and risks in reality, and they are comparing it to theoretical systems that would also have - arguably even worse - downsides and risks, but those are usually downplayed even though they never have been actually realized without these faults, not even close. In other words, anything can look bad if you compare it with utopia.
People are ignorant of how to use reason in morality, otherwise they‚Äôd support rational self-interest. And capitalism can only be morally justified on the basis of self-interest.
We don‚Äôt have capitalism ie a government that secures man‚Äôs right to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness. We have a mixed economy and therefore real problems cause by the mixed economy. However, without an understanding of rational self-interest it‚Äôs hard to understand that the problems are caused by the non-capitalism parts and know the solution is more capitalism.
People support altruism or being selfless, which makes them opposed or not supportive of self-interest, which makes them opposed or not supportive of capitalism since capitalism is based on self-interest.
People who support altruistic goals can‚Äôt achieve them through capitalism and misidentify problems that can‚Äôt be solved with capitalism.
Because everyone thinks that in an alternative system they‚Äôd get to be musicians and professional alcoholics, and not miners.
Cause Reddit is filled with losers who lack the intellect, skill, or determination to succeed under current system
Because Marxism is winning the culture war.
It's just a slogan that they haven't thought very deeply about. Slogans like that appeal to our base, selfish natures which imply that those who don't make a lot of money deserve to take from those who do make a lot of money. Very appealing.
well, after coming out of the r/TruckStopBathroom, the truckers told me that the trucking they do is tied to capitalism.
Because they know that Westerners value freedom. It's not much deeper than that. Anyone who thinks about it with depth will instantly recognize how dishonest it is to put a low income plumber in the same category as literal slaves, much less how stupid it is to put an upper class business owner in the same category. It's a form of emotional manipulation that only works when people don't think about it.
It is an attempt to redistribute the wealth of HNWI. Leftists are basically Marxists who want government socialism. Re-distribution is how they get there. if they can get enough people to believe that they are slaves and the top 1% are the slavemasters maybe they can accomplish their objective.
Note: They cannot.
It‚Äôa a moral attribution of how they appeal to the masses and go ‚Äúyou‚Äù are being fucked by the 1%. Thus listen to them for cries to burn down the system and replace it with their ‚Äúleftist‚Äù policies.
But here is the thing. If there leftists policies had reason, logic and more importantly evidence to back up their claims then they wouldn‚Äôt need such propagandist rhetoric.
They would just point to the real evidence and go, ‚Äúsee, it works‚Äù.
Lastly, let me me part you with how dangerous this rhetoric is. There is no standard of who the 1% are. They get rid of the 1% and there is just a new 1% for them to blame everything on. Neat trick, eh? So there is no solution in that slogan and it certainly is reasonable to counter that they are entering the slippery slope. So, why stop at the 1%, and why not just go at whoever wears glasses? (reference to Pol Pot genocide)
Da 1% == Kulaks
Same dynamic, a class enemy on which to focus the 5 minute 24 hour hate.
This is a Michael scott ass post
True economic slavery comes with the totalitarian income tax. Know any leftists who oppose taxes on income?
They are pimping out the notion that all value comes from only labor and nothing else, so therefore capitalists are stealing surplus value from workers and exploiting them while creating a situation where folks have to work to live. Therefore, just like slaves, they are working for someone else only.
That other folks make the stuff and they deserve to be compensated gets diverted. That labor is only one input into a product's creation gets ignored in often ignorant fashion. That products get made for consumers, the proles as it were, best when folks are allowed to do business and make profit gets smeared. All of it because of a wack ass assertion that Marx twisted from Smith to come to a completely opposite conclusion to economic liberalism
Because they haven‚Äôt lived in the 3rd world
Worker owned businesses are already here. Let‚Äôs check the stats and see if the workers make 10x what other workers make. No. Huh‚Ä¶ There must be other costs and risks involved.
The employer serves an important purpose that people like Richard Wolff miss: they sacrifice present goods in exchange for future goods. This is because they pay workers NOW to produce things that will be sold for money LATER. And because present goods are preferable to future goods, the market determines a rate of return that an employer will receive for making that sacrifice. Note that it is a reality of the world that someone must make this sacrifice, so employees are fortunate that employers make the sacrifice for them. Otherwise, employees would have to work now in exchange for money way in the future. For example, suppose there are construction workers building a house that the buyer will pay for at completion. If the house takes a year to build, the workers probably wouldn‚Äôt be too happy if they had to wait a year to get paid. So that‚Äôs where the employer enters the picture and pays the workers now, even though he won‚Äôt be paid for a year. That‚Äôs a valuable service to society that employers provide. Along with that naturally comes the risk involved in getting paid in the future. When someone owes you money, there is always the possibility that they will never pay you. Or, when you‚Äôre developing a new product, there is always the risk that people won‚Äôt like it and it will fail. Lucky for employees, they get to work on a product that may or may not be a success, but they get paid regardless. Therefore, the employer is providing a service to the employee, because the employee doesn‚Äôt have to worry about not being paid or about possibly even LOSING money.
Now, what if you don‚Äôt value employers, and you‚Äôd rather not be involved in them? That‚Äôs when you simply become self employed. But the objection to this is always something like ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt have money to start a business‚Äù. EXACTLY. The employer is offering you an arrangement where you can get paid without making an initial investment. That‚Äôs exactly why employers are making a useful contribution. If you want to argue that this isn‚Äôt a useful contribution, then why would you work for someone else? You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúemployers are totally exploitative and bring nothing to the table‚Äù and then turn around and fill out a job application. Actions speak louder than words, and in this scenario, your actions clearly dictate that you believe an employer is providing you with something of value.
Richard Wolff has worked and he has formed businesses.
Wolff's arguments advocate for worker cooperatives, which are completely legal.
The thing is, if people wanted this, they could do it. But they don't, they seem to just want to steal what others make for themselves.
The pro-coop crowd never just want to advocate voluntary coops. They always want to legislate them so that your right to sell your own labor for wages is taken away at gunpoint.
He has also made excuses for statist communist systems (i.e. China) despite their genocidal rampages. I don't think he's the moral authority on wealth.
He also advocates for the workers to steal an individual's property and pass it off as their own. I don't take him seriously.
That's a simple minded view.
Every kind of economic systems has its own advantages and disadvantages. People can choose to live where it is more suitable for them.
Today there is what is called ‚Äú Democratic Capitalism ‚Äú. I think it is an excellent economic system.



Complete economic ignorance detected, opinion ignored.
Then do it? Run your own business?
Robert Reich is an idiot who has a very poor understanding economics.
As Stossel says - he's afraid to debate.
Was not expecting to see Sam Reich's dad here.
Robert Reich went to Dartmouth on a merit-based scholarship, graduated summa cum laude and won another scholarship to study philosophy, politics and economics at University College, Oxford, then got a J.D. from Yale. Since college he has served as director of the Policy Planning Staff at the FTC, professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis, head of economic policy transition under the Clinton administration, Secretary of Labor (an appointment for which he was unanimously confirmed), and a member of the National Economic Council. He was named the sixth Most Influential Business Thinker by the WSJ in 2008.
John Stossel dropped out of college (in his own words, he "partied and played poker", was "an indifferent student", and "daydreamed through half [his] classes") to pursue a career in media.
Stossel criticizing Reich for not having an economics degree would seem unfair even if it were true, but it isn't, as Reich does indeed possess a Masters' in PPE from Oxford.
All that education and still wrong about economics.
When you hear someone described as a "progressive economist" you can be pretty certain they are wrong about things. Reich is a world-class ignoramus, flogging long ago debunked and frankly childish economic notions. Its amazing that Iv League schools manage to produce dimwits like this.
Reich calls himself a "political economist." Most of his suggestions are statist and restrict freedom. He just wants to micromanage everyone's life to align with his utopian egalitarian vision.
Somebody tell Reich he can decide what billionaires do with their own money when he contributes something useful to society and gets paid a billion dollars for it. Until then, he can pound sand.
Are you saying this from your perspective as a Billionaire?
Reich is a clown who craves upvotes.
God, Reich is one of the worst people on this planet.
We‚Äôve known.
Ohhh those unintended consequences by do gooders.
At this point, it should be obvious you can‚Äôt legislate the economic outcomes you want, yet people are eternally fooled in to thinking so.
The consequences were both unintended and entirely predictable.
how do you know they didn't want it?
Improper regulation is a great way to kill an industry.
They forgot the piece of legislation that mandates consumers continue buying the service, regardless of whether it makes sense to them financially or not.
So it seems like its raising pay per hour, but lowering the number of hours available to work.
Good if you do it as a side gig at the more profitable times. Bad if you try and make a living from it for 12h a day.
Looks like the market also has a surplus of capacity in suppliers vs demand from consumers now with the price shift.
Some correction is occurring as tips go down with the new fee, smoothing over the spiky pricing from good vs bad tippers.
I'd wait to see actual data behind this instead of anecdotal retelling from the delivery drivers.
I‚Äôm sure the data will confirm. This outcome was obvious from the beginning.
What a super cool and totally sustainable economic system.
I would not trust the self-reporting of a single driver, here. Have you been to their subreddit? They're the most anti-social people; rideshare is basically OnlyFans for men.
I assume your friend is a typical socialist who does this trope. This is a fixed pie fallacy argument.
It's the belief in order for there to be winners there have to be losers.
These socialists or fallacy thinkers often don't understand how even the disadvantaged in economic systems (e.g., not as productive) do even better through trade. This is known as comparative advantage and here is a nice video done by some economists.
Then, let's strong-arm their argument. Africa is a good natural experiment in that after WW2 most all of Africa gained its independence and those nations then had to decide how to govern themselves. Them being very poor and undeveloped from colonial exploitation most people would classify them in the category of these so-called 3rd world countries.
If your friend is right then economic prosperity would be near if not impossible for these countries, right?
If your friend is a socialist then especially during capitalism economic prosperity would be impossible and during socialism, we would see better outcomes, right?
After all, this is the basic view of the "exploitation" of socialism.
So I will demonstrate how those claims of Western Capitalism only succeed because of 3rd world exploitations fall short by using the African continent as a form of a control group, its history and data of independence from colonialism post WWII, how many nations shifted towards socialism (i.e., African Socialism) after WWII with their newfound independence, and then with the fall of USSR many countries then shifted towards Liberal form of governments. THIS history we will see a shift in economic well-being that destroys their notions and supports liberal governments that support market forms of economies over socialism (i.e, pro-capitalism) do better. It is NOT foreign exploitation these people make their false claims.
You will see it both in the stagnation of their economies as 'they' - the leaders - chose African Socialism - and then you will see a rise in the economy as these countries chose to shed socialism after the fall of the USSR.
My premise has to do with following global GDP and below nations' GDP with the fall of USSR in 1991. Globally many nations saw they would no longer have the support and/or saw the writing on the wall with socialism and started to shift economically right of their socialist positions with the fall of the USSR. Even authoritarian communist nations such as PRC and Cuba would take on more free market policies.
look at what has happened to many socialist nations (i.e., African Socialism) when they shifted to more liberal forms of government (90s-2000s).
Then look at the (hardcore) socialist nations with the fall of the USSR (1989) and shifting to more private ownership enterprises in their economic systems.
Then a quote to put in perspective what the era of African Socialism was like:
Meredith, Martin. The Fate of Africa: A History of the Continent Since Independence (pp. 378-379). PublicAffairs. Kindle Edition.
Sources of (failed) African Socialist States in above data with a shift to liberal governments: Benin (1972 to 1990), Mozambique (1975 to 1990), Zambia (1973 to 1991), Tanzania (1967 to 1992), Angola (1975 to 1992), Ethiopia (1977*-1991), Ghana (1960s to 1993), Guinea (1960 to 1992), Mali (1960 to 1992).

Lastly, I can't summarize the entire history book above. But here is a pretty good article. The important thing to add is how the Cold War post WWII gave African Leaders and Nations their independence and their shopping (if you would) between the USSR and the USA. The African Leaders and rightfully so looked at capitalism with disdain from the centuries of (exploitation) colonial capitalism. They also saw how well the USSR had done with going from very poor to a superpower. They wanted to model that system and large swathes of African Leadership model single-party rule systems with their version of African Socialism. This, in a lot of ways, was a disaster (e.g., famine).
Conclusion: If their claim is the only reason Western Nations were wealthy is because of the exploitation of 3rd world countries by 'the west' then we wouldn't see a dip in GDP in African Socialist Nations when shifting to Socialism and more importantly a rise in GDP when shifting to pro-market economies with Liberal forms of government.
Lastly, if they are Marxist or using a Marxian lens, exploitation is just really hard to define and then measure.
I'm not saying above in my comment the world is perfectly fair. I'm just saying, imo, it is too often a crutch by socialists and other not well thought out people. Your friend may be well thought out and can give empirical evidence such as child labor and so forth. There certainly are causes we all can get behind.
But just the simple broad brush strokes like your OP suggests, I'm in the political not-so-fast camp and data driven for the best social progress for everyone.
For now, let me demonstrate the difficulties of the exploitation camp has:
Add China to the list of examples. Perhaps one of the biggest turnarounds in living standards since opening up trade with the US in the late 20th Century. All that "cheap labor" hired by the US moved the country from 45 million deaths from mass starvation under Communism to fewer than .7% (10million) of 1.4B people living in extreme poverty.
The standard of living for Great Britain almost doubled between 1800-1860 because productivity increase. First, labor saving inventions and division of labor (see pin making example). The productivity of the average Britain increased which caused increase in standard of living.  Britain colonization didn‚Äôt really pick up until the late 1880‚Äôs. Also, China created 100 mile economic free trade zones which resulted in 500 million people escaping poverty. 
Show him the poverty rate around the world and notice the drastic decline over the last X number of years (can choose whatever range, 30 is probably good because that‚Äôs when computers started to come into the picture). Just because living standards improve in the west does not mean living standards are declining everywhere else.
Capitalism is not a zero sum game, that‚Äôs a common red herring. On average things are improving for everyone on a macro level. Don‚Äôt let him cherry pick statistics here and there, you have to look at it as a whole.
What specifically is he pointing to support this statement? He is saying that there is only one reason for capitalism's success (exploitation of the 3rd world). I wouldn't want to have to prove that personally.
Ultimately he is thinking through a zero-sum game perspective and you are arguing from a win-win scenario where you can create value for all parties. History doesn't support the zero-sum game view. Standards of living have only improved with time: medicine, technology, and worker safety among others. There are certainly problems but they are shared by all systems not just capitalism.
r/AskEconomics has a post that talks about this.
Reality is complex. Both sides of your arguments have truth to them. We get a lot of cheaply made products from 3rd world countries. Also, 3rd world countries benefit from globalization which is a capitalist based system.
Real world things are complex and have a lot of sides to them. Human groups are like organisms interacting. Some exchanges are symbiotic others parasitic and so on. You can't describe it with just one word, but overall, the vector has been pointing in a positive direction in terms of poverty reduction. That doesn't mean there aren't things that couldn't be improved or that there are no things to be grateful for.
How so? Particularly from 1945-1975, the US standard of living grew while producing most of its goods within the US.
Consider China. The CCP has corrupted world governing organizations like the WTO in order to directly resist and ignore humane labor practices that apply to the rest of the member nations. In a similar manner they have exempted themselves from the carbon restrictions that apply to the rest of the world. What you see here is not the western capitalist world screwing over the people of China, but instead their own CCP. If you look to the CCPs trade practices abroad with its belt and roads programs, the aim there is to put third world nations in debt for political leverage, resource stripping, and their oppressive surveillance state. It is the CCP that is sanctioning organ harvesting, Yugar genocide, child labor, prison labor, slave labor and toxic dumping in their own nation. So yeah your friend has a point if their aim is to hold the CCP accountable. But if instead their aim is to smear the rest of upstanding western civilization which embraces labor standards, environmental laws, and human rights, well they are sorely misguided. This is not a general problem with capitalism, but instead a specific issue with bad actors like the CCP

I suspect that many of the same people griping about "surge pricing" are the same people who routinely complain that fast food workers don't get paid enough
Can you provide me anything that indicates that surge pricing will directly go into the pockets of workers and not just the company itself? We‚Äôre not talking about independent contractors here like Uber, since when do hourly employees see bonuses as your implying as a result of surge pricing?
Im curious about how it will go since it will be the only surge price in a sticky price market on top of being pretty elastic product. I dont know if it will be successful because of that but if it is then long lines at Wendy's will disappear which would be nice.
Exactly. And the proposition is even riskier because with something like Uber, people really want that ride without many competitors. A Wendy's is usually surrounded by competitors.
They can try this and see if it works. Since Wendy's is failing right now as a franchise, it's a bold move. We'll see if it works, Cotton.
BTW, I actually like Wendy's as a fast food place.
Good thing is, like you said, I can vote with my wallet. If surge pricing hits in my local area, I just stop going there. I don‚Äôt go there much to begin with, but every once in a while, I get a hankering for one of their burgers, and a frosty. If that completely stops, then that‚Äôs fine.
I was recently in Chicago, needed the typical Uber around 4 PM. Surge pricing was in the area of $55-$60. You know what? Cabs did not have surge pricing, everybody‚Äôs trying to hail a cab. Free markets.
One of the fast food chains will make a public stance and state that they will begin lowering prices again. That will set the tone for the rest of the market‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I can vote with my dollar? So that's why our votes don't matter. The billionaires vote for us.
So, just the old supply and demand pricing, just more up to date? OK lol
There president is a 'Socialism of the 21st century' type

This motherfucker is actually high off of his own fart fumes.
Who cares what Columbia thinks
"Columbia", lol
Absolutely nobody.
What a massive loss for Israel. All of the fruit borne from their decades long alliance with Colombia is swirling the drain. I have no idea what they will do in the face of this staggering loss of support.
Russia, go invade whatever country you want.
Israel? Strike back against the people who murdered over 1000 people and want your country obliterated and all Jews killed? Not allowed.
Always okay to hate the Jews, ain't it?
Criticism of Israeli foreign policy is not antisemitism
Most of the South American countries are second banana to African countries in terms of irrelevancy in the global scene.
I think it should be illegal to involuntarily kick someone of a jet because of overbooking. So if airlines wants to overbook flights they still can, but if they end up with too many people for the flight, they need to start offering compensation until someone volunteers to take the next flight. If it takes $100K to get someone to volunteer, then that's how much it takes.
The thing is, they aren't involuntarily kicking anyone off the flight. If you bought the ticket, you agreed that you have read and agreed to the Conditions of Carriage which state that this could happen.
Europe has passenger rights that force them to pay a bit per denied/delayed (3h) boarding.
It depends on the distance. Overbooking is fairly controlled because of that.
IDK, it seems it's something we've simply accepted. I think as long as it's included in the terms and conditions when buying the ticket I don't mind it. Depending on the country obviously there are laws about it too (if it's allowed, compensation etc.).
Speaking of I really need to work on my attention span when it comes to TaC stuff. I‚Äôm sure that even when I read through all of it when they‚Äôre presented to me I‚Äôm bound to miss important details. Probably by design no less.
This piece goes into it at length

I feel so much better about airplanes now that I don't have to go in them anymore. The entire industry needs some serious shaking out, and as far as I know TSA hasn't stopped a single bomb or terrorist by xray-ing their shoes. (or by any other method) The big result of the TSA is long lines, long waits, and nasty airline reps run amok while they demand more money and force you into smaller spaces. If I can't drive there I'm not going. 9/11 gave them an excuse to make plane travel a permanent nightmare.
The TSA has about a 98% failure rate. It‚Äôs a mix of bureaucracy and security theatre that just makes life worse.
God I wish I could just drive everywhere. I unfortunately am unable to due to eyesight loss and god forbid I want to go anywhere outside 100 miles it‚Äôs either fly or spend my life‚Äôs savings on ground transportation. The fact that all the airline companies really work together in reality to set shitty standards needs to be addressed by a government reform at some point.
As someone who travels 330-350 days a year, trust me, I get it. It sucks so bad when that happens.
However, it's not a scam only because it's outlined in the airline's Conditions of Carriage document that you attest to having read before you purchase your ticket.
They can always come back and say "We told you this was a possibility when you bought the ticket and you bought it anyway."
Your best bet if you're worried about the possibility of an oversell or missed connection is to book business or first class for those flights.

The Charging Bull statue on Wall Street that represents the stock market and financial district is the best symbol.
A grocery store with food in it
...And another across the street with more but different food at different prices. 
... And a dollar store in the lot next to it. Across from a Walgreens and CVS.
A picture of well fed people with a prosperous middle class?
You don't need a symbol to define the normal state of humanity; only when you deviate from it.
This.
The term "capitalism" is itself a socialist / Marxist pejorative term designed to attack the natural right of humans to own productive assets.
USD or üí∞
A widely recognized one? I don‚Äôt think so as capitalists aren‚Äôt that united. But the dollar symbol is good. I can‚Äôt think of a better one.
Not sure, but it's probably just a photo of a full dinner plate.
Late Stage Socialism always happens. And it destroys countries.
and kills.

I we gonna just ignore the embargo?
There is an HBO documentary that used to be available on YouTube for years. Can only find trailers now.
Patria O Muerte: Cuba, Fatherland or Death
https://youtu.be/MCl334UDbio?si=B0hnRm7hDsjw9AxU
The United States maintains a comprehensive economic embargo on the Republic of Cuba.
Sanctions definitely play a role but economists overwhelmingly agree that Cuba‚Äôs low growth is due to internal policy rather than the embargo
What role, if any, do you think US sanctions played in the collapse?
socialists: So aniti-capitalism that when a society is spared contact with capitalism they still blame that capitalism.
If communism works so fucking good then it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Capitalism acknowledges the reality of human nature to be selfish. It's imperfect but is the one system we've found that actually harnesses "greed" and the self-preservation instinct in a way that has benefited most everyone else.
Socialism is based on the idea that human nature can move beyond our base instincts, and trusts that the leaders empowered to distribute wealth are incorruptible, and that the risk-taking that fuels innovation can be architected centrally and collectively rather than via individual entrepreneurship. It can work for a while, but invariably devolves into "Animal Farm" style cronyism and, often, authoritarianism.
Communism is obviously different and can feature free-ish markets or command and control style economies. Human nature is for power, so it'd be unusual for a communist government to be able to sustain truly free market economies for very long. The temptation to pick winners and losers is far too strong.
logical breakdown.
In the end, Socialism and Communism are deluded about human nature.
I‚Äôd argue that socialism is greed to the extreme. It‚Äôs a brilliant way for the people at the top to amass extreme wealth while maintaining control over the masses. It‚Äôs an exercise that‚Äôs been practiced since the beginning of humans and is hidden within many capitalist societies, under the guise of ‚Äòkeep voting for me and I promise I‚Äôll give you [xyz]‚Äô.
They don't believe they're making the world a better place, they think they will get to take people's stuff and not feel like the losers they are.
Sadly for them, the true believers end up against the wall or in the gulags.
Or put to work somewhere.
No one reads a thing here huh?
How does a socialist even troll? They are broke lol.
Imagine a world where communism and socialism weren't the same thing. Just imagine.
It depends on the socialism now, doesn't it ;-)
A socialist is just a communist that hasn‚Äôt managed to gain a monopoly on use of force ‚Ä¶ yet. 
No. This is a good move for him. He's angling for 2028.
Agree. There have been several conservative things he has done in the past year that point to this (like the condoms in every school, which meh). Also trying to be on Fox. It will be interesting how he will try to market himself.
Trying to win conservative goodwill with an absolutely empty gesture, knowing the state will go blue no matter what.
What does this have to do with capitalism?
Unfortunately he is a rather savvy politician. He knows when to look like the better man. He is going to try and appeal to the independents and moderate democrats who have started questioning the party.
Can the mods start removing posts that have nothing to do with capitalism?




You believe that



Show me where he was convicted for being an insurrectionist.
There's nothing special you need to do. Just work hard, invest, and don't vote for any dumbasses.
Word hard, stay motivated, risk capital, invest wisely, take profits when appropriate, and retire early.
Congratulations you‚Äôre a capitalist.
If you believe that private property should be respected and protected, and that private investment is the best way to achieve your own personal goals and also the best way to benefit society as a whole, then you are a capitalist.
Next thing to do is to live out those beliefs in your own life.
Don't hurt peole or take their stuff.
Capitalism is nothing more then free markets, ie: lais¬∑sez-faire. Do you believe human interaction should be voluntary and consensual? You are a capitalist.

Well, as unfun as this gonna sound work a job and put some money away into a ROTH IRA, and look for jobs that have 401k. Have an adviser for the company whose ROTH you are doing help you with the what kind of accounts to open up.
I myself am going in on real estate, and have worked about 13 years getting the connections to make stuff feasible and know dudes in the trades who will cut me deals and help me out
A lot of good advice is already at the top of this post. Only thing I'll add is that you can't do much about your intelligence, your capacity is your capacity. What you can increase though is your conscientiousness. Whatever you can do to maximize this trait, it will pay off in your journey through capitalism.
Simply not wanting to take other people's property, income, or tell others what to do with their property is enough.
The first step is learning what human capital is and how you own your body, making decisions to learn and be valuable to others.
Watch I, Pencil
Buy a stock, enjoy capital
This is the capitalism subreddit. Are you lost?

I'm not sure how this fits in this sub but 16,000 of these people are inside where the rally is. The rest of this alleged crowd of 54,000 people are supposed to be in this crowd and I don't see 54,000 people in any of the photos or videos. Remember when a group reserved a large portion of Trump rally tickets and then left the seats empty? It's why he allows way too many people to request tickets now but he constantly exaggerates the number of people at his rallies. There are a lot of people there but I think it's clear that a lot of tickets were reserved but not used. The number of tickets reserved is probably inflated anyway.
54,000 + 16,000 = 70,000
Disgusting
more Trump hatred, so what else is new, i think this is the prime-mover why (reddit) was re-calibrated in 2020
How will you know when communism has been achieved?
that indeed is a great question, thanks!
-Can communism coexist with capitalism? Why not? You will get a long winded explanation about how authoritarianism is good -Can communism be voluntary? Same as above -How do you protect individual rights in communism? This is more than likely a trick question because communists don‚Äôt care about individual rights -Ask who would enforce the rules -Ask who governs -followup with asking how they protect minorities or marginalized groups -Ask if you will be required to work and if not, how much you will get for not working and who will pay for it
thank you! I have tried asking some of these questions, all i got was unsatisfactory solutions which plausibly can be applied only in a utopian world. I‚Äôll surely ask them these and see if they can come up with something better!
"What's for dinner?"
What if you felt differently about a protest and your boss made you protest for Israel?
What could you do to be represented and heard?
2) Say a small population in a communist country, in the 21st century, find themselves to be trans, and face the same issue above. What would be the proper material dialectic to explain this phenomenon, and can the development of that discussion turn in time for something to be done in support of them, while they face minority suppression meanwhile?
I'd say these two questions tackle everything lol
As a Socialist, I‚Äôll give you the best one I know:
How do you resolve the transformation problem?
What‚Äôs objectively moral or what‚Äôs moral in reason?
Show them the human development index, and all countries at the top of the list are either mixed or market economies and none socialist or communist.
That's not how inflation works.
Yeah, he seems to be mistaking lower inflation for deflation.
Biden is an economic genius. (/s)
Joe Biden doesn't understand inflation, but then we have known that since he took office.
To be completely honest, you could have stopped that sentence at "Joe Biden doesn't understand."
This is called political theater. Those same corporations are his buds and donors.
"or what?"
It seems he doesn't understand that:
A: with a market prices can't be artificially held by a company.
B: Slowing inflation doesn't mean we are in deflation, lowering prices is a deflationary situation, we are solely in slower inflation.
For ‚Äúhis‚Äù next trick he‚Äôll fix prices of goods, services and wages. For our safety
The Biden administration is run by simpletons with little understanding of economics.
There's no such thing as artificially high prices when enacted by a private actor - it's only the state that can enforce artificial pricing.
Inflation doesn't mean that all goods and services increase by the same amount, or even close to it - it's a general rise in prices.
Amazon and Walmart, both employers of last resort for many unskilled folks both raised entry level wages to get first dibs on those workers. Very few employees actually make the Federal minimum (less than 2%) and the market has moved on. The real minimum wage is $0.00
It limits competition.
They say it so they can push the talking point that you are repeating. These are people who have gone full surveillance state and will fire someone for trying to make a union, super illegal, but who cares.
There are 3 alternatives-
Capitalism, you pay what it costs for the things that you want (including labor).
The govt pays for the things that you want (including subsidizing businesses payroll via welfare), thats forced state dependency, aka communism.
And workers are defined by classes, some of selected for liquidation- thats capital K, stalin grade communism.
When you definitely know what communism is. Lol
Ftr leftist no longer argue for 15$ minimum wages, those are numbers from 10+ years ago. Now it is a liveable wage in which is argued for, based on where you live. In the US it averages out to be around 25$ an hour. This includes needs such as food, childcare, healthcare, transportation etc. and I believe a family of 4. If people are better off then people will have more children and invest more in the economy. See the 1950s-1980s for examples. Also i recommend looking at graphs of ‚Äòminimum wage with productivity graphs‚Äô from pretty much any source as they all correlate, but CEPR is one example. Therefore, amazon is behind where they should be and are taking the wealth from their employees. You talk about a time that the US was great, economically it was when the minimum wage match production output.
I have a very hard time believing that minimum wage could sustain a family of 4 on a single income anywhere in the US from 1950-1990.
What fiat money does to a country üò•
You can't win an argument with a leftist, they don't understand what an argument is.
They'll avoid, deny, shift the goalposts, lie, straw man, ad hominem until you're sick of it and throw in the towel.
They'll do absolutely anything other than use reason, empiricism and observations based in reality.
Any leftist born after 1993 can't argue, all they know is appeal to emotion, anecdotal evidence, avoid drawing things to their logcal conclusions, refuse to do qualitative economic analysis, and lie.
Amazon raised the minimum wage after Bernie sanders pressured the company with regulatory action.
Fyi, $15 an hour was pocket change in 2015, basically impossible to live off of now.
Sounds good huh? Sounds maybe too good to be true?
Just wait until you find out how you will be expected to make up the shortfall. I'm sure you'll scream!
Cons always trying to make up the windfall instead of cutting their own salaries is why you can't trust Repiblicans to actually have policy instead of pandering to retirees.
Will they be replacing it with anything (e.g. LVT)?
I can't seem to access the article :(
Sales tax hikes
So, this is going to be a study? How would one apply for this?
Except Florida has hotel and sales tax to tax nonresidents who come down for the winter. Cut government spending and lower taxes across the board. 
If ever there was a reason for extremely low single rate tax system set by the taxpayer, then this is it.
Poor tax. Its 100k off the value of property that can be taxed, $250k off if over the age of 65. Giving home owning seniors (the single highest voting rate, and also the age demographic with the highest home ownership) a massive tax cut, while raising consumption taxes which will harm non-home owners and younger families far more. Snowbirds (usually wealthier) spending only part of the year there will benefit even more.
So a regressive taxation scheme.
I believe that was the original bill but now it has changed.
Oh please let this happen lol ü§û
