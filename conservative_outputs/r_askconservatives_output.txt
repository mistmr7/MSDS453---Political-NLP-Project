Probably a mix of youth and some other factors.
I think broadly saying the Redditors don’t have jobs is sort of a wild proposition.
Any platform that is largely used by young people will have a left leaning tilt because young people have a left leaning tilt. On top of that, younger left leaning people are far more likely to engage on social media than their more conservative counterparts, generally.
I think this sort of ends up being part self filling prophecy, part apathy on the side of young conservatives, and part fear. I don’t think most young leftists would have any fear of getting cancelled for posting a left wing take here or on any most social media platforms, but I think a lot of right wing young people would.
Reddit's main demographic is younger males with a college education. Think 27 to 35 year old white collar professionals. That's a pretty liberal group.
Reddit also very coincidentally went from being liberterian/moderate-left to hard-left around 2016.
Because reddit has no problem getting rid of groups that get too big that are conservative
Moderators on subs and reddit admins are left leaning and enforce content policy in an ideological way. The bar of tolerance for right wingers is much lower so they are more likely to get servers banned, quarantined etc. And a lot of people who are more right wing won't talk politics much or just stop using reddit because of it.
Then there's the question of who wants to be a moderator for a political forum on a social-media site. It takes up quite a few hours in the day, hours that someone working full time and supporting a family doesn't have. That leaves young, underemployed types with a chip on their shoulder.
Sure, there are innumerable specialty subs that don't have that problem, but the political ones are going to be staffed by a certain demographic.
Reddit users are disproportionately younger, that's the main reason.
A smaller reason is that reddit censors certain viewpoints which pushes Conservatives off the platform.
It is a mixture of different things, but I think a big reason is moderation. The_Donald was a huge right wing, pro Trump, Maga board that was one of the biggest on the site before it was taken down. Since then, right wing views, or views that are not considered offensive or controversial to conservatives (such as opinions on trans people, immigration, race, culture, etc) are considered hate speech by moderation, so most right wing people either don't feel welcome so they don't stay, they don't voice their opinions so you wouldn't know they were right wing, or they get kicked off of sub reddits or the site as a whole.
The left is currently going on a purity spiral, so it’s just the natural progression of rational leftists being silenced so the small minority of crazies seem bigger.


I don’t consider people who are left leaning to be my enemies. I might not have the same views as them, but that doesn’t make them bad people or “enemies”. Many people in my life are left leaning.
Never have
Never. Stop listening to anyone who uses language like that because they're just plain dumb and/or dishonest.
As far as I can tell the vast majority of us love the US and want it’s and by extension our prosperity. We just disagree on how that happens. I don’t have enemies here, or at least I don’t see anyone as mine.
The main republican candidate uses language like this. Honestly I sort of agree with some of what he says. Stop illegal immigration. Yup Id like that. Reduce inflation? Sign me up. Maybe disagree on how we wants to correct them but overall im aligned with a fair amount of the problems he sees in the country.
However his rhetoric is probably the single worst thing I don't like about him.
No one is my enemy. But when I go to subs like r politics it is quite obvious I as a Republican am the enemy of almost everyone there.
Yeah it's quite a shame that something like politics can create such divisive situations. I'm pretty left leaning in a lot of my views but my AA sponsor of years now is a very staunch conservative and it has in no way affected our relationship at all. We are both respectful adults that can keep our politics to ourselves but for the most part whenever it comes up we listen to each other and find some middle ground and then that's that. I think the bigger problem is why can't people just talk to each other like two respectful human beings.
Long days and pleasant nights
You haven't.
I am only the enemy of those who seek to destroy this country, or those who have decided that I am their enemy.
I wouldn’t say we are enemies! Both are fellow Americans on both side of the political spectrum just want what’s best for the country! And both right and left have its case of nutcase’s on the far right far left.
With that being said I’m going to give you my opinion to your question! I used to be a democrat before Trump I was still young but old enough to vote. To make a long story short I didn’t end up voting for Clinton and my father who was a democrat all his life wasn’t voting for her either, when I asked why he would do that and vote for someone like Trump we had a long talk about politics which won’t go into detail about but it all boiled down to the left doesn’t believe in meritocracy and believe in equity more than equality which didn’t sit right with him, still I wasn’t sold on Trump although he did seem like he cared about the working class citizens of this country with some of his policies like cutting taxes for the middle class and wanting to stop funding so much money to NATO and putting tariffs on companies that moved out of the US in hopes of bring back jobs to Americans! Long story short Clinton had a lot of shady stuff going on with her emails and then she called Trump supporters deplorable’s! So I said fuck her and Voted for Trump while I was a registered democrat.
Since voting for him I had a lot of really liberal friends ostracize me call me a racist which they could never give me a straight answer on why Trump is a racist and why I am too for voting for him. Funny thing is none of my black friends could have gave a shit who I voted for except only a few but they never went as far to call me racist! From 2016 up until today I have to here from dems outside and inside congress make statements that because I’m a white man I’m inherently racist and an oppressor even though most my family settled in the north right before the civil war began when they came to this country. And on top of that I’ve had to see Marxist groups like Anti-fa and people from the lgbt community mock my religion burn our Bible de face and vandalize our churches and burn down communities and small businesses all in the name of social justice…. Please give me a break! I watched those same people de platform other American’s because they had a different political view’s than them, would see news reports almost every month of a man or women being beat or killed just because they were wearing a red maga hat! This is not the America I grew up in and it wasn’t the party anymore that I thought it was. So I permanently left the Democratic Party after 2020 I refuse to be apart of a party where it’s people villainize’s me because I’m a white Christian man. And I personally don’t like Trump all that much but at least he seems to give a shit about our country and brought us 7 million jobs, brought our unemployment rate down to 3.5% and drew up the plans to get us out of a 20 year war!
Op I like that you’re reaching out to this community and asking this question we need more of it! Not everyone from different sides of the political spectrum is bad, but I think you should ask yourself what has my party done to get conservatives to think we are enemies as I should do as well!


I think it's time to admit that the pro-life movement isn't about preserving life.
Her story is heartbreaking. She and her husband held out hope that the baby could live, even with a hard life, through multiple tests. But this is full trisomy 18 with multiple deformities incompatible with life. Doctors said baby will maybe live an hour to a week IF it makes it to birth. I just listened to her story, I cannot believe the SCOTX ruling.

A right Libertarians who's actually a Libertarian
They've never been "pro-life". They've always been pro-birth. If they were pro-life, they'd be trying to help feed and house the poor. They'd be adopting and fostering all the MANY, MANY kids in need. But they're not. Because once you're born, they really don't care.
100% this.
The supposed movement of small government and less state intervention believe a state lawyer has more right to dictate a person’s life saving healthcare than the person themselves.
Interesting you should say that. I want to say in the first topic there were a few conservative posters that believed that the threshold had been reached, but I’m not seeing them here now, just you.
So the "Death Panels" will start soon.


Yes, I think this should be standard. Unpopular opinion: I also think your tax records, criminal records, and medical records should be public access as a burden of running for the Presidency. You should be fully and 100% transparent.
Yes. Trump has already taken at least two.
It shouldn’t be a formal requirement, though.
Harris' cognitive abilities aren't in question, and Democrats turning around and demanding Trump take one now when they were desperate to protect Joe from taking one for years, is the height of hypocrisy.
I’d be fine with that requirement but it would require a constitutional amendment. As far as Trump doing it voluntarily for the 2024 election, it’s too late for that. The primary is over. The convention is over.
I already replied, but I just want to note that Trump turned 78 last month, not 79.
Yes! Also, HIPPA should be amended to allow for a requirement that candidates for public office should be required to disclose any intellectually-debilitating conditions. For example, if a candidate has a traumatic brain injury, I think the public has a right to know about it.
Yes. 100% yes. I don't care who the Presidential candidate is. This should be a minimum requirement.
Yeah, it should be a requirement of all individuals over retirement age in public office.


"Post birth abortion" doesn't even grammatically make sense.
Because a lot of them are really stupid.
I've always heard "post birth abortions" used to describe the withholding of medical care to a child that has just been born due to abortive procedures who is having difficulty achieving circulatory and pulmonary stability in the critical transitionary period which occurs during the first few moments after birth.
Aka, these children "die in a bucket", "die on a table", etc.
Would it be ok if we banned it then?
Ban infanticide? It's already illegal.
It's literally illegal already.







I'm pro-choice, but abortion advocates have increasingly advocated for states to pass medical exemptions to abortion cut offs that include mental health.
Several states already passed mental health exemptions, including New York.
So this creates a loophole because no one knows how serious someone else's mental health is. If I say I'm depressed at 35 weeks, should that really be sufficient for a doctor to abort a viable fetus?
Personally, I'm pro-choice by way of right to bodily autonomy. But I still acknowledge that this is a loophole enabling "abortion up to moment of birth". I don't think anyone "delights" in making that choice though.
Thank you, this was very helpful.
Is it really a loophole or just a way to cover very very rare edge cases for where abortion is appropriate?
According to the CDC's Abortion Surveillance — United States, 2021 which was completed in Nov-2023
Given that only ~1% of abortions occur after 20 weeks, are your fears of any meaningful number of women seeking abortions for mental reasons at 35 weeks warranted? I'd suggest anyone truly concerned about abortions should be focusing on the 93.5% of abortions that occur within the first 13 weeks and trying to find out what support women would need to make another decision.
People aren’t going to abort a 35 week fetus for mental health reasons. Is there any data on how many times this has occurred? What I found is that in 2018, 1.3% of abortions were performed after 21 weeks.
When you consider that some people only find severe chromosomal abnormalities or structural defects after 21 weeks, that leaves few performed for maternal health reasons. Of those, for mental health?
Only a psychopath would terminate a baby at 35 weeks pregnant. The pregnancy could be induced snd the baby would generally be ok. You would have to get a doctor to vouch for the mental health issue (maybe psychosis or severe depression with suicidal ideations or serious suicide attempt). In that case the baby would be delivered. Not killed then delivered.
The point is that New York believes government should not be involved in these decisions.
Longer than I think you want to believe. The republicans got angry before the Civil War because the democrats kept trying to push their values BEYOND their borders.
If there is no abortion equivalent of Dred Scott, there will not be a civil war. Because on that occasion, after that ruling, the republican states were like, "okay, so that's how you want to play it huh? well fuck you" and elected Abraham Lincoln.
I am a pro choice conservative and I also agree with what you are saying. I personally wish this side would drop the issue completely as it’s a losing one. In the end we will lose elections and a national protection will be passed, we will lose on every other issue as well as a result of it. 
I think if we want to see a compromise this side needs to come to the table and propose a 20 week limit with exceptions for (rape, incest, disability, and risk of the mother) country wide. Then put its focus on incentivizing a woman to choose life over abortion. This seems like a reasonable restriction and is in line with most of the other civilized countries. Of course people will be too blinded by the issue to push for something reasonable like this as they want a total ban and it’s going to bite us in the end. 
too me its aggravating because its a losing battle their willing to go into. Like it or not people value freedom more. Sure we live in a hedonistic society, but societies that value things like personal freedom, tend to be like that. no one is telling the extreme religious right they have to live like us. yet they want to force their morality and ideas on us anyway.
This is more of a question for ask a liberal sub. Why in the world does the left want such policies? I can't wrap my brain around it and yet they do often support these things. I have a hard time with the left justifying abortion to begin with. Why would anyone want much less justify killing a human life to begin with? How is that ever a real choice?
For what reason would they refuse to add a time limit in legislation? Why? Minnesota has no limit on when you can opt to end a pregnancy. No limit on how far along you are or how old you are. You want to I know why some believe this, look no further than the wording of legislation. And Minnesota is important now, right?


I'm not sure what you're talking about, what are we supposed to believe that Biden is guilty of?
Trump is probably guilty of lots of things.
Trump is guilty of a lot of things, it's just he is only getting in trouble for it because of politics. Biden is getting away with his crimes because of politics.
Well if we look at the most obvious right.
Both presidents illegally withheld classified material. They both stored them in unsecured locations. They both explictly read them to people who where not cleared to hear this information.
Trump gets charged. Biden gets off becuase he would have been to sympathetic to a jury.
Or the Trump estates over evaluation of their assets. Setting aside the fact the banks, got paid, where happy to take his loans, didn't feel victimized, would happily take more loans, and did their own assessments on the back end of his properties worth.
Setting all that aside.
If the dude did overvalue his assets, to a gross degree, maybe he should actually be fined for that.
But my dude. 400 million.... 4000 fucking million dollars in fines.
That's a blatant attempt to ruin the man.
There is plenty of evidence against Joe Biden.
Trump has been the victim of selective prosecution. The Leticia James case had never been prosecuted in the history of the statute. The Jan 6 case and the Georgia case have to prove Trumps state of mind and the statutes were twisted specifically to get Trump and the Mar A lago case is based on a civil statute and never should have been brought as a criminal offense.
It is political theater all right. The idea is to convict Trump of SOMETHING to keep him off the ballot in Nov.
The Democrats are VERY afraid of Trump. They desperately don't want Biden to run against him because they know he will lose.





There is evidence.
Without any evidence? What evidence is there against Trump? Please use reliable sources.





It's a tough question.
I used to be heavily against censorship like any freedom-loving American, but I see how out of control misinformation and disinformation has gotten in the past few years and it deeply concerns me. I get the idea of fighting speech with more speech, but then it just becomes a jumbled mess where nobody knows what's true.
Right-wingers are completely insane with their conspiracy theories. Everything is a conspiracy. Nothing can be trusted. But instead they just believe absolute nonsense? That's not a good system.
Unfortunately, trying to censor people, even the most utterly insane and dangerous people such as Alex Jones is just pouring gasoline on the fire. It makes them even more radicalized.
The cat's out of the bag, and the cat is tearing up the apartment like a whirling dervish. You try to grab the cat and it just slashes you to ribbons before continuing its frenzied destruction, even worse than before.
I feel like all I can do is watch as the whole place gets destroyed. And the whole time the other people living in the house are cheering.
It's madness.
I agree, but I would say that the best possible way to counter this problem is to focus our education systems on critical thinking.
When I grew up (not that long ago), so much of what I learned in elementary, high school, and even into college (at times) was focused on memorization and recalling basic facts. We all now have instant access to infinite information.
What we need to do is to adjust our education standards from recalling information to determining what is good or bad information. I’m not saying that this is any easier, but I truly believe that re-focusing on critical thinking is essential.
Around the time the HBO show Chernobyl came out I heard an interview discussing it and one comment stuck with me. It was, "the purpose of propaganda isn't to make you believe the lie, it's to make you doubt the truth."
What we're seeing here with some people repeating the same lie over and over again is exactly this. It's being done deliberately and it's targeting the American people.
I don't know what to do about this either but we can see the effect it's having on our society and the public discourse.
I agree with you and honestly, I've been wondering if this isn't the biggest issue we should be trying to solve... Another comment mentioned civil war ... CIVIL WAR!!! I haven't heard that other people were talking about this, but this is the stuff of nightmares. It would destroy our nation so utterly all of us would lose and none of our issues will seem relevant then. :(. But what can we do? I feel like rational people of all political persuasions should be working together to cure this one. It's the foundation of our democracy.
just wanna say, I read this entire thread, and I think this is the most productive and civil discourse i’ve ever seen on this sub. I don’t really see anyone arguing, but more so actually discussing an active issue within our society. It makes me wonder if this idea of misinformation in the 21st century can end up being a nonpartisan issue that conservatives and liberals can come together on. No one wants to be mislead or lied to or played for a fool. This could be a good start to realizing that the left and right is truly just wings of the same bird.
This film does a great job of explaining the techniques of propaganda.
The first step in understanding how we survive is education. Not knowing you are being manipulated makes it infinitely easier to be manipulated.
Acknowledging that propaganda campaigns are prosecuted across the manner of society helps too. I often see people so entrenched in their own belief that they can not accept that "their side" is wrong, using manipulative tactics, or attempting to mislead people. It is hard to overcome the thought you could be wrong because it is literally ingrained in our psyche to reject that which contradicts our core beliefs. If someone has convinced themselves that "democrats are the party of good", then their brains will literally attempt to reject information that may contradict that notion. I say democrats, but it applies equally to both parties.
I have hope because the world exists outside of the internet. I encounter people all the time that somehow can not wrap their brain around me being conservative because of how I live my life and how I treat other people. They struggle because they spend so much time in a bubble that demonizes conservatives, with propaganda, that when they meet one in real life that doesn't fit the caricature they've concocted, it seems contradictory to them. A popular phrase has become "touch grass", largely because there are people that understand the world is not entirely what we consume.
I think the "shared" part is crucial. Untruth has always been a fundamental part of public life, but the most recent development is the market offering more individualized lies for various groups all living in their own bubbles, rather than the old shared lies of centralized mass media. In the absence of any popular political faction that puts any value on truth, it looks like it's going to continue to be a competition for control over information outlets (like Twitter), and, failing complete control, more and firmer political separation (which would not be terrible).


Hilary Clinton never apologized when her campaign started the birther conspiracy








A man being charged with lying to the FBI tells the FBI that Russian agents were feeding him information. Why do we assume the second thing is true given the first thing?
I have no problem believing that such a thing could be true, and I personally believe that the Kremlin would love a second crack at a President Trump, but to treat his claims as proof like you do is not warranted yet.


It's hyperbole. No, Biden didn't watch over a civil war like James Buchanan, nor did he bloat the entire government like FDR, And he also didn't completely destroy the conservative movement like Reagan. Biden's faults still put him on the same tier as George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and LBJ, with his handling of immigration and the awful economy for working people.
Can you elaborate a bit?
Agreed there’s more than enough immigrants, we’re an overbooked hotel, but the Obama/Biden Administration ofcourse deported more than Bush and Trump. It’s a dual issue- there’s so many of them but they’re out here doing the jobs millennials won’t.
More damage than the last 10 combined is probably an exaggeration.
On your points
I don't blame Biden personally for most of the inflation problem. He has some responsibility, but the Fed should take the most blame. But the public is usually less forgiving, especially when Biden intentionally was promoting "Bidenomics" for years, unnecessarily taking personal responsibility for the state of the economy. If you add up the cumulative inflation for his entire presidency, it's about 25%. Your money has lost about a quarter of its buying power just while Biden is in office. People are feeling that.
The stock market looks like it has done well, but not if you factor in inflation. Then it's just barely ahead.
Afghanistan pullout made us look weak, and open to challenge. The likelihood Russia included this in their calculation for rolling into Ukraine is high.
The country is at $36T in debt. Before the pandemic we were spending about $4.5T per year. Trump's emergency Covid spending level in his last year in office bumped that up to $6.5T, which he should get criticized for, but it is at least understandable for a temporary emergency.
Biden on the other hand simply continued the Trump emergency spending as the new normal spending level. No year under Biden has reduced spending below $6T. We simply don't have the money to endlessly throw at Ukraine or other foreign conflicts. The rapidly rising debt is making us weak.
On the border, we didn't need new legislation. Just don't throw out the Trump policies as soon as you get into office. He did that. Illegal immigration goes through the roof. Then pretending the issue is that years later Republicans didn't support some new legislation? That's not a serious argument.
Inflation adjusted, VOO is up over 50% since 2020, or 9.43% annually. 
https://totalrealreturns.com/s/VOO?start=2020-01-01&end=2024-07-19
Just a point of clarity here that inflation in the United States had different causes than inflation in Europe. If you measure Core Inflation (the kind preferred by economists) instead of Headline inflation you can see we performed much, much worse, and that Europe’s inflationary woes were caused largely by the Russia/Ukraine war, which sent their energy costs spiraling, not monetary policy during Covid.
It seems that America's is caused more by demand-pull, while Europe's is caused by cost-push.
 What has Biden done to create demand-pull?  Should we not have raised wages? Should Americans have increased consumption after COVID more slowly?
You state this as if this inflation was an act of God. Perhaps there were elements - COVID supply constraints and the Ukraine war. But the largest factor was multiple major governments dumping stimulus into a quickly-recovering global economy with supply constraints, and the US contributed strongly to this error.
I reject the suggestion that "everyone was doing it, so it was not our fault". The stimulus in 2021 once it was clear that the economy was recovering was a stupid idea, and people were saying so at the time.

Ive noticed the same. Every conservative thread, news outlet, talk show, youtube show, claim the whole thing is a sham and a miscarriage of justice but never actually explain how or why. The closet I've seen is the the claim that it wasn't falsifying business records, it was "misclassifying them". That way of describing it makes it seem more like an accident than an intentional falsifying. Idk, sounds to me like cognitive dissonance more than anything.
How’s the mood in your community since the Trump conviction?
Pretty much unchanged.
Except at the dog park this morning. The Pug Lady greeted me when I went in and asked me if I heard Donald Trump got convicted.
No! Really? I hand't heard. Must be a busy news cycle or something.


Like, all political speeches are bad, but wow.
And then I see [this video] (https://twitter.com/SenKatieBritt/status/1765944735154274774) and wonder who gave her the advice to deliver the speech the way she did.
I agree, the style she went with is totally mystifying. Some consultant somewhere is having a bad day today.
I refuse to believe that is a kitchen in a house with two teenagers in it. Where the hell is all their stuff??? That place looked creepy as hell. What RNC media consultant okayed that set?
Katie Britt is married to former NFL player Wesley Britt, who is now a consultant and lobbyist, and they have a net worth of between 1 and 5 million dollars according to her declarations. That kitchen (and the staff to clean it three or four times a week) are definitely in the realm of someone worth that much with their combined incomes.
ding ding ding
I suppose, but we all talked about Bobby Jindal and I don't think that was very helpful for his political career.
The forced melodrama was something I’d expect from Hillary.
Recalibrate, Katie. No need to go full MTG. Watch some Margaret Thatcher and learn.
Hillary? I can't remember once ever seeing her on the verge of tears.


I don’t think it’s as bad a pick for the left as the conservative media pundits and r/Conservative are making it out to be. That’s not to say I support the guy in any way, but really it doesn’t matter who was chosen. They would’ve labeled them the “most progressive pick ever” and continued their chants that there’s no way Kamala could win. We need to be living in reality and the reality is that this election could very easily be slipping away from Trump.
Really, really feels like r/conservative has their heads in the sand regarding Trump's chances in November. He keeps going on with stupid nicknames, talking about a black woman's race, and his usual antics while the average American really only cares how much their food and rent cost. Do you think he will pivot to a more focused approach or has that ship sailed?
It just looks like a ticket balancing pick to lure in people who may be skeptical of Harris. Not at all an uncommon strategy.
My totally uninformed take is that I've heard of him and my friends who live in Minnesota don't hate him, so he seems like an "average to decent" midwestern Dem governor. I've heard nothing to suggest he would be a terrible President if it came to that.
On the other hand, the very early reaction is that this is more about pleasing progressives than making a smart electoral college play by Harris, which seems to be troubling a lot of people who want Harris to make good decisions, for whatever that's worth.
I'm friends with some people who work/worked in Minnesota state politics, some who worked for Walz/the DFL and some who worked for the state GOP. From everything I've heard, Walz is a pretty genuine and decent guy. He's fairly liberal, but reasonable and is willing to reach across the aisle to get things done. My only real complaint with him at this point beyond policy differences is his handling of the 2020 riots, I thought he should have sent in the National Guard way sooner than he did.
I think Shapiro would have been a smarter pick than Walz for VP. Harris needs to win Pennsylvania to beat Trump and I think Shapiro is better positioned to deliver it than Walz. That said, Walz is by no means a bad pick. He's a very safe pick for VP that plays well to the suburban swing voters that Harris needs to win. I think he'll be effective at turning out Democrats in the Midwest without further energizing the right against him.
I'm actually surprised at the pick. He seems like a decent Democratic politician. Good man, not radical. However, what does he bring to the ticket? Does he help win states like PA that Gov. Shapiro would have been better suited for? Those are the questions that need to be answered, and only time will tell.
He’s a midwest Democrat who is popular in his state and has been very effective at getting widely popular progressive programs like free school lunches and maternity leave passed with a slim majority.
Also he’s a former enlisted soldier. A former teacher and successful football coach. Has a decade+ experience on the Hill, representing a Trump-leaning district while still basically being an unapologetic leftist. Managed to get one of the VERY few expansions to the VA passed in the last 30 years.
And he’s very good at making people look like jerks when they interrupt him.
It's way smarter for Shapiro to remain as Governor, seeing how popular he is there. His position gives him a lot of influence over PA voters, VP or not, and he can join Harris when she's in PA.
I'm not familiar with his record in Minnesota, and I have no real views on him.
I think it's shocking that she passed up the chance to lock down Pennsylvania by picking Shapiro. I guess their interview must have gone poorly?


did people think trump was actually pro life? where u been the last 40 years, the man was a democrat turned republican. Lots of conservatives are pro choice nowadays. Not prochoice into third trimester though, limits on how grown a baby can be before you go and kill it.
We can all agree that no one is promoting abortions post birth though right? That one just blows my mind.
How can it be that we have been discussing this at length for years, and you still believe that women are carrying healthy babies to term only to abort them when they are viable, weeks before their due date?
I am not sure how a person can believe this without also having a deeply fundamental disrespect, disregard, and distrust for womenkind.
Here are the facts: late-term abortions happen when the baby is medically not viable or the mother’s life is at risk. Or both.
We’ve already seem the outcome of late-term abortion bans: dead mothers.
I know a ton of pro choice people including myself and I don’t know anyone who is pro abortion in the third trimester unless under a very specific set of circumstances
And yet he promotes three supreme Court justices that overturn roe v wade. And guess what, that wasn't by accident.
And yet he promotes three supreme Court justices that overturn roe v wade. And guess what, that wasn't by accident.
The only people surprised by this are the Redditors that have been consuming propaganda that Trump is some kind of ultra-conservative right wing extremist. He's not and never has been. Spoiler alert: He's probably not all that religious either.
Then why did he promote three supreme Court justices that overturned roe v wade?
This is not about Donald. He didn’t say there is no room for compromise. I’m not surprised neither of them are pro life, I’m surprised she said we can not compromise with conservatives on this


E-Verify adoption is has been glacial...but most places that have put it in effect are Republican states.
This is a good step, but I'm looking for something targeted towards people exploiting illegal labor. If your business regularly relies on 20%+ of your workforce being illegal then that should be investigated.
Why hasn’t the adoption of e-verify matched the urgency of Republican messaging? Especially since Trump’s first campaign, we’ve been told that illegal immigrants are an invasion, they’re destroying America, etc. But they’ve still slow walked an obvious measure that would reduce the number of illegal immigrants.
Never ask a man his salary
A woman her age
Or why Greg Abbott has failed to implement e-Verify for 8 years running
Because Republicans for the longest time are mostly neocons who don't oppose cheap labor for business.
This is a fundamental part of the republican party. Complain and do nothing meaningful.
Some have. Just never establishment guys like mcconnel and the ones in power.
ya know I wish I could say different about the Dems but......
I appreciate the response and candor! Thanks for the reply!
Republicans see the issue as a supply one rather than a demand one. The issue is not that companies or individuals are purchasing labor from illegal immigrants, but that immigrants are here illegally.
In broad strokes, much like other Republican economic policies, they're looking toward addressing the supply of cheap undocumented labor instead of pretending that we can do anything substantive about business demand to keep wages low.
This seems a bit backwards? Aren't the Illegals coming for the companies that will hire them? If no companies would hire them they wouldn't come.
But we need to be careful about a definitions. There are people that are here legally but are just waiting for their court dates and all the administrative bullshit. I think a lot of us can honestly say they know somebody that is here legally but has been tied up in the court system for years. What are the people that are waiting their court date just to get a piece of paper to say they can work here that have done everything else but are waiting on some bureaucratic administrative services and some random court date. If you are allowed to be here but are waiting on a court date we need to speed that up. If you have no court date and did not come here appropriately then that needs to be dealt with. But I think if we stop dicking around and actually gave enough money to the court systems to get these people through the court system in a timely fashion then we could actually focus on how many people are truly here illegally.
It is very wrong to have a system that allows someone to be in a legal gray area. like you have a social security and you have to pay taxes don't get it wrong these people pay taxes they pay taxes I'll say it again they pay taxes but for some reason they're not legal until the court says they are there is something wrong with that seems pretty shady to making them pay taxes but not give them citizenship and hold them up in the court system for years so we need to fix that after that we can talk about whatever amount of illegals.


I mean, that's pretty racist.
Are you concerned that Trump is allowing someone with such reprehensible public opinions into his inner circle?
It makes me view her negatively. So yes, it bothers me.
He defended her today...he subscribes to her views and perspective by keeping her around. He had her at the 9/11 rememberence 2 days ago despite her saying it's an inside job.
You're asking if Laura Loomer is a piece of shit? Yes.
Loomer has always been gross. Those of us who were supporting other candidates in the primary were trying to warn everyone that Trump keeping lunatics like her in his orbit was going to come back to bite him.
it bothers me on many levels.
beyond the obvious stunning racism too.
first it implies liking foreign food makes you less of an American which is dangerous.  that kind of purity logic is what leads to Chinese people celebrating a bus stop murder of a Japanese woman last month-- and saying the Chinese woman killed trying to intervene deserved it for helping a Japanese.  it was so bad they had to take the rare step of rebuking nationalism on their social media platforms and mass deleting posts.
that's where this ends, if unchallenged and widely accepted.  
It bothers me too.
I think it's more ethnic food, not foreign food. Indian Americans (not to be confused with Indigenous Americans) have been in the USA for quite some time. To me, it sounded the same as if she said "The White House will smell like fried chicken and watermelon after Kamala moves in"
It's deeply offensive and breathtaking that kind of hateful sociopathic commentary is allowed into the mainstream.
Well, let's not be hasty. Consider the context, which is...
I got nothin', folks. Yep, it's racist.
This is the lady who got banned from CPAC in 2019. She's literally radioactive. I have no idea why she's sharing space with Trump.
Of course, my biggest objection to him has always been a lack of basic leadership skills, and surrounding himself with exactly the wrong people is a symptom of that.
Good lord are all of you exhausting sometime.
Just once can we have a popular post not devolve into slap fights and hyperbolic platitudes?
Y’all need to go out in public, find someone you disagree with and have a conversation with them…. Figure out how to talk to each other like human beings.
I don't know. It's not a good line of attack. The GOP has been plagued by counterproductive messaging ever since we took the Devil's bargain with Trump.
The election can’t come soon enough.
It’s going to be nonstop nonsense for the next several months, isn’t it?
It's not so much the run up to the election I'm worried about, it's what happens after.
Honestly, he should have just stopped at "we're being run by childless cat women". If he had left it at this, then it would have been crystal clear that his point wasnt to attack people for not having children, but rather attacking people who are clearly so bitter about their lives that they enact or push for policies that ultimately ruin the lives of those around them.
But I take issue with his follow up comment that "the future of the Democrat party is being run by people with no children" which does raise the question: are you attacking people simply for not having children? Why?
It's an argument that's becoming more common in conservative circles - this idea about having "skin in the game". I've heard conservatives in this sub and elsewhere say that people who don't have children have less stake in the future, just like they also say people who don't own property or make high incomes don't either. Follow it through, and these tropes are leading to some ugly directions.
Gonna go ahead and say it once again: Men who denigrate single childless women with cats are just salty because so many of us these days are looking at our companionship options and choosing an animal that shits in a box in the house over men.
Minimal extra work to clean up after it, no constant demands for (terrible and unsatisfying) sex, no having a baby and being expected to be the only one providing actual child care, no working full time and coming home to another grown ass human's messes, dirty laundry, clutter, and demands to be cooked for, no insecurity over interacting with or even being looked at by other men.
With a cat we buy the food, we scoop the litter, we clean up the occasional random vomit, and we vacuum hair. Sometimes they bite, I guess. They can be a bit loud too. That's about it.
Dudes need to wise up and start being better partners if they want to compete.
With upcoming drugs which may dramatically increase human longevity, millennials or perhaps gen z or alpha may have "skin in the game" for a long, long time. Depends on when they become available. It will still be a few decades, but progress on mice is astonishing.
Did you happen to see that her step kids mom came out and endorsed her and stated unequivocally that she was a very active parent to the kids and a huge part of their lives? I thought of you when I saw that and was curious about your thoughts.


This isn't a conservative thing, it's a traditional Catholic thing.
The common conservative talking points you are likely conflating with this issue are #1: Abortion laws #2: Reduced sexual education in public schools.
I actually know many Catholics who are not against birth control. This position is nowhere near common amongst American conservatives.
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/tlOSQAzMJT
I think this is an extremely uncommon position
Funny how this is such a common taking point on the left and I've never actually seen one person advocate for it.
I consider myself Republican - I would vote for free birth control for all - all day, every day. Fewer people my tax dollars have to support via social programs for life in the future.
So there was the hobby lobby case where conservatives did not want to give birth control pills to unmarried women working at hobby lobby. The conservative supreme Court sided with them. I think. There was also some places in the deep south where the Republican conservatives did not want free condoms given out in high school or was it college. They thought it might lead to more sex in high school students or college students.
Also, they are really, really bad for womens health
I first read IUDs as IEDs and got really concerned at how much people don’t want kids anymore 
Well, according to abortion on demand advocates, they dont work. So why bother?


He’s an extremist and a clown. I would never support him.
I am not surprised in the least. The guy has been saying ridiculous things for months. The fact that he was even more of a hypocritical oaf before politics when he was younger shouldn't shock anyone. He never should have been selected in the first place. He will likely go down as just another poor primary pick that scuttled an otherwise winnable race.
Broadly it might either hurt (or help) Trump's chances at the presidency. If voters turn out to defeat Robinson (because he is profoundly stupid and should never be Governor) they will also likely vote for Harris at the same time. Equally, Robinson's clownish behaviour might push up his opponent in the polls so much that voter turnout diminishes as the threat of Robinson winning diminishes, thereby helping Trump.
If he doesn’t lose another 10 points off stein after this, wtf does the GOP really believe from a standards point of view.
He's a total nut job, though we already knew that. This seals the loss. 
The implications for the presidential race are limited. Trump could maybe gain a little credibility by denouncing this clown, but that's not his style. 
I wouldn't vote for him if I lived in North Carolina but I don't so I'll have to content myself with not voting for the idiot that the Minnesota Republicans picked as their Senate candidate.
LMAO, I almost forgot about that guy. I feel for Minnesota Republicans on that front. Why do you think they picked Royce White of literally ALL people? I think I've seen the consensus is Klobuchar will win anyway so they just gave up? I still don't understand why they went with that guy, no matter what
Late stage culture war candidate. Unsurprising.
The GOP is its own worst enemy holy shit
There's just too much bad faith here. Locked.
I find it rather ridiculous. Why? Because it makes literally no sense, why would you abort a baby when you are 9 months pregnant.
Less than 1% of abortion occur past 24 weeks, and the only instances we see past that is for lethal complications.
No. He floundered in the debate. I was pretty disappointed honestly. She paraded fear mongering bullshit too, but it doesn't excuse his bullshit.
They're eating the dogs.
I
Kamala got away with some stuff for sure. It was crazy to watch Trump self immolate himself, then go ‘wanna see me do it again’.
No
No.

Wow. Tell me what was it like in 1992 when Casey effectively overruled Roe?
There are conservatives in office that support different parts of project 2025. I just don't think Trump supports much of it.
If Trump's staff supports it, then his personal stance on it doesn't really matter.
Genuinely, how the fuck did you get "fooled" by the overturning of roe? That's been a political goal for literal decades. It's not exactly like it hit you out of nowhere.
Let me try to bridge the gap here. By many mainstream liberals, Roe v. Wade was basically considered settled law for many years. It was assumed that many Republicans like to use it as a wedge issue but that it wouldn't actually get overturned. I (even as a mainstream liberal) believed at the time that that view was naive.
There were a lot of moderates who didn't believe the right was serious, outside of a handful of true believers, and we're just using abortion as a wedge issue to drive the religious right to the polls. I think a lot of conservatives like McConnell believed this too. Like sure they'd pass laws limiting abortion, but never outright restrictions. And most especially not laws that messed with protecting the woman's health, or forced her to carry to term even though the fetus wasn't viable.
You seriously didn't see people saying that Trump's election would end Roe being told that they were just fear mongering and that it would never actually happen? It was an extremely common tactic. Obviously they were all lying, but it seems like it worked on some people.
To start with, overturning Roe was in the official 2016 Republican platform (and previous ones):
And in the third 2016 debate, Trump even said it’d be a foregone conclusion if he was elected:
The 2024 platform will be written at the convention next month.
But what concerns you about Project 2025? I’ve found that it’s majorly blown out of proportion. In large part, it’s just a book that’s published every four years, and it even contains explicitly competing policy suggestions, like “The Case for Free Trade” and “The Case for Fair Trade”. Did the prior versions worry you as much? And did your interpretation of the worrying parts happen?
I think this is the connection to Roe v. Wade OP is making. That is, a rightwing policy outcome that had previously been widely considered as unlikely (at least by many on the left) ended up happening, so now other far-fetched rightwing policy ideas warrant more attention. And to give you a specific example of what in Project 2025 might concern OP, it literally calls for banning pornography. Huge government overreach.


Those that care about those things got outvoted in the primaries by those that think other things are more important. So now those that do think it is important have only a binary option.
What is more important than morality?
yup, its disgusting.
Probably as far back as the colonial era.
Ben Franklin wrote an entire essay on the joys of courting older women. And by courting I mean introducing his frank to them. Probably nsfw http://www.bibliomania.com/2/9/77/124/21473/1/frameset.html
Jefferson got one of his slaves pregnant. He later made his children by her freed slaves.
Franklin never became president and Jefferson wasn't technically a republican as the republicans had yet to exist, but the founding fathers weren't perfect.
Followed up with JFK (also a democrat), who had a lot of affairs. Democrat, but famous for being assassinated.
LBJ , who nicknamed his "frank" jumbo, and also claimed he could bed more women then JFK. Also (D), and the D is unrelated to his "Frank". edit: Actually has nothing to do with adultry but the man was also well acquainted with the N word.
Bill Clinton (Also D), who's not only alleged to be a rapist but only got impeached because he lied about his affair with Monica Lewinski.
Grover Cleveland (D) was accused of being a rapist. Probably fathered a kid out of wedlock too. Anti corruption maybe, but anti rapist maybe not. Personally I'm inclined to believe he's a rapist because the mother of his child says the kid was a product of rape. edit: Actually after further digging Cleavand might be a groomer too, considering he was an adult that knew his wife while she was still a child, and married her when she turned 21.
Jimmy Carter probably didn't cheat on his wife, but he did admit in a playboy interview that he wanted to do stuff with other women at times. He might be the tamest one on the list though.
People want their presidents to have integrity but sometimes you get stuck with whoever has the best platform.
edit: Since presidential dirty laundry is kind of fun.
Warren G Harding (R) knocked up a women 30 years younger then him. A DNA test eventually proved paternity.
FDR (D) had love letters written to another women, his wife eventually found out.
Andrew Jackson (D) married a women before she even divorced her first husband.
There's probably more unreported presidential affairs, and I could probably do a better job of finding sources, but I'm lazy.
Do I wish the nominee had a more virtuous character? Sure. But I'm still not voting for Biden.
Will you vote for Trump?
That ship sailed in the 90’s when I was scolded by the Democrats, who told me that the moral failings of the president was irrelevant, and that only the job they did in office was what mattered.
So here we are.
So if Bill Clinton hadn't done what he did, you would consider Trump's immoral character a disqualifier?
Did you really believe in it if you were only going to follow that principle if democrats did as well? I don’t think the moral failings are relevant since those exist regardless for that candidate regardless of the election outcome.


Can we make it a rule or something here that when a questioner makes a post, they have to include some kind of reference as to what TF they're talking about?
Added a source. There are a ton of sources on the topic and I hesitate to choose one as I don’t enjoy being sealioned and told I’m just listening to MSM, which happens each time I list a source.
Every single time you include a source here, you are told that your source isn't good enough so you have to go find a foxnews or OANN source. And this is one of the bigger stories if you listen to any news, but looking at those sources, the only thing about the republicans blocking this are about the fact that there's some language that says LGBTQ+ people have to be treated fairly.
Based on some quick googling, it sounds like those red states already have programs set-up and aren't interested in the added effort of adding another program that does the same thing.
It's not always about evil republicans hating kids bro.
"Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement that he doesn't want "a single Oklahoma child to go hungry, and I’ll keep working to accomplish that, but large, duplicative federal programs don’t accomplish that goal."
"Implementing a Summer EBT program this year was “not feasible” in Texas, state Health and Human Services Commission spokesperson Thomas Vazquez said in a statement to the AP. He said that was due to USDA guidance coming in late December, ”the level of effort needed" to start a new program and the need for the state legislature to approve money for it."
"All 50 states already administer the Summer Food Service Program, which provides sites where kids can eat for free. Vilsack said he’s worried it doesn't “provide the help for all the children, no matter how well-intentioned it is.""
The summer food service program is what they’ve refused for this summer. There is not additional coverage, at least in my state.
So Oklahoma does not have another program to take its place. This was the program we had. The tribes have had to step up and except the funding since the state refused it. So the tribal nations will be handling it.
Idaho has no program in place
There are other places, like youth centers, where children can go to get fed that are open year-round. If they are fed at schools that entails a lot of cost.
That is not a feature of rural communities.


I don't care what any of them do.
I don't care about their personal life but if there is ever any appearance of grifting from top government positions then no stone should be left unturned.
We're supposed to be holding these people to a higher standard, and we're not.
So, the question, it seems, was aimed at conservatives as a whole, not at individuals avoiding vocally committing to the actions taken by the congressmen they elected or the news channels they’ve made popular. Beyond your own unwillingness to stand behind the conservative talking points, why do you think conservatives, as a whole, as a political movement, have chosen to dive into hunter biden’s personal life, but not the trump kids?
If it was only you making up the conservative movement, your original answer would have been helpful.
Are you serious? The Trump kids were attacked nonstop
There was plenty concern about Jared Kushner not being able to get security clearance and all of the kids international incomes
I believe the issue in related to Biden's potential involvement in his sons business dealings?
Sure tabloid/click bait news posts silly stories about hookers and drugs, no one really cares about that, it's just a side story that got headlines as it's a bit nutty but the real reason why people care is the potential misconduct of Biden.
How do you feel about Ivanka Trump being granted 41 fast-tracked trademarks (40% of the normal approval time on average) in China after her father became President? If you read this, I want you to imagine if the Biden's had done this same thing while Trump was president, what would your reaction be?

In 2018 ZTE, a Chinese electronics maker, stopped operating after the Dept of Commerce penalized them for breaking sanctions and selling stuff to Iran and North Korea. A week later, Trump decides to remove the sanctions to save the Chinese company. Less than 2 weeks later, Ivanka Trump had 7 trademarks approved.

A similar event happened in Japan - Ivanka was granted fast-tracked trademarks (less than 1/3 the normal approval time) after meeting with the Prime Minister.
What about Jared and Ivanka's business dealings with Saudi Arabia at the same time that Trump signed a multi billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which just so happened to coincide with Kushner recieving a 2 billion dollar 'investment" from MBS?
Hunter’s drug use was Trumps biggest talking point in the debate with Biden. So he really cared about it.


Because non-citizens are voting in local/state elections around the country. For example:
https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/maryland/frederick-maryland-approves-non-citizen-voting/65-3335485f-8e2b-4d2f-abeb-fc3bba7032a3
I think this confuses some people (possibly the immigrants themselves as well).
Kinda funny, the lone Republican voted for it, and the dissenting vote was a Democrat. I think all the reasons given make sense, but ultimately they shouldn't get to vote...
Noncitizens cannot vote in any state elections. They can only vote in a handful of local jurisdictions. In some of those places, noncitizens can only vote in school related elections if they have kids in the system.
This seems like a local issue; do you think that voting should be handled federally or on a state level?
There are 16 states that allow one to acquire a drivers licensed without proof of citizenship. There are 24 states (25 if you count DC) that allow one to register to vote if they have a driver license without checking citizenship status. Some of these states are the same ones once someone gets those things it's very easy to transfer that illegal right within the United States to more stringent states. There is no way to fix this current problem without completely purging voter rolls.
https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/diversity-inclusion/594617-16-states-allow-undocumented-migrants-to-obtain/
https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/09/22/states-with-automatic-voter-registration/75254847007/
Non citizens have a different ID than citizens. It is obvious when they apply for a job or try to vote.
Illegal immigrants are counted in the census which determines the number of representatives each state gets. Therefore states which house illegal immigrants get more political representation than states that do not.
If it’s any consolation, California has 70 times more people than Wyoming but Wyoming has the same number of Senators. The Senate and the electoral college favor red states, so whatever small imbalance from the census, red states still have a massive advantage in our political system. Not to mention that the census has favored red states in recent years.
Which is kind of a hilarious thing to be worried about when every single state that effects has proportionally far less representation than the smaller states that don't have to worry about it. But I guess we need more DEI for rural whites.


All the usual suspects are still being assholes and I really don't see much done about it.
When the moderator team gets reports for bad faith, y'all really need to look into the user's profile to observe their history of ignoring the purpose of the subreddit to engage in bad faith posting rather than take everything in a vacuum. Almost every single one has a clear history of violation when you look into their posts. We ignore patterns at our own peril.
There should be no giving benefit of doubt this deep into the subreddits downfall and this far into election season. Give them their punishments and if it was truly unwarranted they'll simply return after it's done with or someone else will take their place. There will always be an endless claviclade of progressive and leftist guests, what we need to do is conserve the finite resource of quality right-wing posters willing to put up with them to answer their questions.

Good Lord these replies are depressing.
Trump can't not grandstand and rant.
Yeah, Biden probably didn't write the tweet himself, but does that really matter for this kind of simple holiday statement? Are we suddenly demanding presidents write their own speeches?
Say what you want about Biden, but he's not the narcissist that Trump is.
I am a true conservative that wants a fiscally responsible government unfortunately neither of these candidates are for the same so for me I would rather have a candidate that cares about democracy then one who will just try to get revenge on his enemies.
What I hope is that trump loses and that next time around we will have somebody who is more in line with conservative values because if he wins I feel he won't give up the seat or future republican candidates will even be further right wing and wanting to have a government that's fiscally responsible will be just a thing of the past.
The Trump tweet is awful, and are any of us really surprised?
The one written by Biden's staff is more professional and civilized.
In fairness, Trump did also post a perfectly boring tweet that was no less-appropriate than biden's: https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112512868823830235
Yeah, Trump is a pretty crappy person but half of voting America still thinks he is a better bet than the Democrat's policies.


I watch FOX NOW the 24hr stream. It is just news with cuts to local broadcasts and the occasional commentator to add context. It plays entire speeches and news conferences start to finish. It is honestly a pretty solid news channel.
I don't watch the entertainment/panel show bs.
Completely fair, I also hate it when Trump is not able to finish his thoughts during interviews.
I wish we'd go back a decade or so to more civil discourse.
Welcome to how we feel about ABC, MSNBC, and CNN
If the issue is excessive interruptions and talking over, why don't you feel the same way about Fox?
Is your point that excessive interruptions are okay if you agree with the political content of what's being said?
It's annoying, but it's also annoying when someone is asked a specific question and they start talking about something completely unrelated
I know there's a lot of finger pointing going on here, but this is how every dem felt yelling at their TV when Vance was asked "who won the election?"
I seriously am sick of no one being able to answer a direct question. Both dems and republicans.
I mean hasn't that just been every news network or political thing for the last like 12 years? How is this fox exclusive?
He had to because she goes off into her 5 minute circular talking points that we’ve all heard before.
