Is he the most based democrat? or just dumb even by democrat standards?
Dumb as a door knob. No disrespect to door knobs.
He‚Äôs just that dumb. He and Headboard Harris are perfect for each other.
He took a demotion to avoid deploying to Iraq.
I was under the impression he had already served 20 years when he reenlisted for four more 4 years of service after 9/11. He then retired honorably after almost a quarter century of military service when his final enlistment extension was complete. Where am I fucked up on this?
Edit: Lot of wild fluctuation on upvotes and downvotes on this comment as I read replies. Guys, I don‚Äôt give a fuck. I can‚Äôt pay my mortgage with Reddit karma. Let me know if I‚Äôm missing something about the guy, I‚Äôm reading all the replies.
Just another fake puppet the left is propping up.
Dude did 24 years in the Army (national guard, but I digress), and attained the rank of Master SGT (E-8) and only earned 3 awards- the Army Commendation Medal, and two Army Achievement Awards. I did 4 years, attained the rank of Corporal (E-4) and I earned 8 awards. I have friends who were national guard, with no deployments, and they earned at least as many as I did. There's a term for people like Tim, it's called "ate up."
Also, he retired before picking up E-9 and just before his unit deployed. Sounds like he retired to avoid deploying. Sounds pretty cowardly to me.
Edited to add further facts and details, corrected rank of retirement.
How the hell did I have leave the USMC as a Corporal with a bigger stack than this mf, all I did was fight the War on My Liver in Okinawa.
He also said he wants states to not have reciprocity for concealed carry licenses

‚ÄòDo not bring the Second Amendment into this courtroom. It doesn‚Äôt exist here. So you can‚Äôt argue Second Amendment. This is New York.'
this is cause for open rebellion imo
Grounds for appeal!
This is open rebellion.
Agree. That judge is a traitorous piece of human excrement and should be reminded who has the real power here.
Recall the judge
yes, I mean if you are going to deny the constitution you are supposed to up hold and protect then you shouldnt be here, gtfo!
There is no 4th amendment in this courtroom! There is no freedom of speech here! Funny how crazy this logic sounds when it's applied to anything else huh?
He She said the quiet thing out loud.
4th Amendment says you can't. 2nd Amendment says you won't
not without dire consequences, for sure
You think these tyrants care?
But she just said that she's not coming for our guns?
/s
THEY aren't. They're gonna send other people after them
And they aint gonna be "walking" into your house when they arrive. They will be breaking down your door, guns blazing. Dogs and people are going to be killed.
Bees are legal to keep in every state in the union. Bees hate loud, percussive noises like flash bangs and door breaching. Bees will prioritize potential threats that are moving fast, or wearing dark clothing.
The bees will not drop their weapons. The bees will not get on the ground.
Save the planet, start keeping bees.
Why must the Democratic Party platform be like this ü´†
Guns shouldn‚Äôt even be a partisan issue
FKH! FJB! SIC SEMPER TYRRANIS!
But but but something something take the guns first!
If this election wasn‚Äôt more obvious who Second Amendment supporters should vote for I don‚Äôt know what is.
The people against his release always leave out the facts that the dude he shot had the ak47 at low ready and multiple people were already banging on perry's car. Low ready is very different from just pointing at the ground. At the time this happened we had recently seen stories of people in portland being executed by antifa for being trump supporters.
I had completely forgotten about those executions.
Exactly. Low ready means he can move and be ready to shoot in half a second. Do people need to wait for him to open fire before they respond
Yahoo is reporting this as "man shoots BLM protester and gets a pardon". They never mentioned that it was someone holding an AK-47 lol. If this were a conservative, it would have said "far right white agitator was shot while he was pointing an assault weapon at a peaceful protester"
And the leftist subreddit of r/Texas is losing their minds.
The amount of people calling Abbot soft on crime and wanting to take his pardon powers away is hilarious.
‚ÄúIt has long been my conviction that a masked man with a gun is a target. I see no reason to change that view." - Jeff Cooper
This should've happened sooner. Otherwise, I'm glad.
Fuck austin
Oh man were the cry babies out in force in the Austin subreddit. So much fucking salt you could walk on water.
If you go to r/Colorado, they are actually celebrating that the bill is dead. You know you fucked up as a Dem when a state sub opposes your bill. Each and every state sub (even solid red ones) is filled with leftists.
state subs and even city subs are horrible. all populated with hardcore leftist, communists.
As a latin person, to see a fellow latin pushing a gun ban bill, I consider them traitors to the Constitution and a disgrace to latin people. If you come to this country to fuck it up by helping the government in changing the Constitution and take our rights away, go back to the shit hole where you came from. You are not welcome here.
I can't be impressed or hopeful about things like this until we see the people who propose for and vote for it getting hit with criminal charges and removed from office.
It's SOP for Democrats. Feinstein, every year, submitted a Federal AWB. That's what is meant by saying the price of liberty is eternal vigilence. These Fuckers never stop.
As a Virginian, I was shocked when my state sub blasted Governor Blackface just before covid hit and the Dems tried to ban literally everything. 
As a reminder to all: almost every Dem state legislator in Virginia at the time voted for the most aggressive bans except for a couple senators and one or 2 house reps. They were all primaried out by gun grabbing leftists recently. 
Our state is screwed once Youngkin is gone. I am glad Colorado has maybe a fighting chance though.
I still can't believe Virginia turned blue. Never in a million years would I have thought that possible
Fix that state and we‚Äôll move back in an instant! Love that place. Might even go live on a mountain like cripple creek. But until the government stops trying to mimic the west coast, we‚Äôll have to unfortunately stay away.
This is why I never got behind the " Back the Blue" shit, so.many of these fuckers would gladly do it and use your owning a gun as an excuse to run a Bradley through your front window. And we all know Scotus would back their use of force.
Never trust a cop to choose between your rights or their pension. We know which one they'll pick. Prep accordingly.
Cops doin' the math on how many door knocks they have to survive: *incoherent screaming*
Why does she want to kill cops?
Because she‚Äôs been pro defund the police, for a while. Do you really think she cares if police get killed trying to enforce her unconstitutional crap?
Sounds like what pretty much any DA would do...
This is why lists of gun own owners is a bad thing, not a uniquely bad thing about Harris.
fuck the police. they don't give a fuck about you or your rights.
Like the police don't have anything better to do. But then again, under her administration, they probably wouldn't have anything to do because she would let all the criminals go anyway.
Cops would love to kick in doors. They absolutely want citizens disarmed and defenseless. That's why they're exempt from gun laws. They will always follow orders to keep their job and expanded rights.
Regardless of what her intentions are here we should be very afraid of what a Harris Presidency would look like. She has already shown her true colors in California. She doesn't care about the law or the rights of the common man. Time to lose some guns in a boating accident and make a cache.
ATF are murderous thugs
They refuse to wear body cameras despite being instructed by the DOJ to. That should tell you the intent of the ATF isn't in public service, but rather covering up their responsibility and actions.
Assassinated.
Yeah I‚Äôm surprised I had to scroll this far down to find this. This guy was more than likely actually assassinated by the state.
It absolutely wasn‚Äôt one guy conducting this raid, dozens of guys and not one persons body camera was working? We don‚Äôt actually have gun rights in this country.
It‚Äôs not that they weren‚Äôt working. They don‚Äôt wear them. Going against their own and DOJ guidance. So they can shoot you, your dog, and your neighbors house without repercussion.
So they can makeup rules on the fly and raid people‚Äôs homes over them, but the rules they makeup for themselves, they can just ignore entirely?
Edit: The ATF: ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Dallas!‚Äù
As I see it- if there's ANY sort of officer involved shooting, and the officer was required to have or use a body cam and didn't, the burden of proof should be on the officers or agency to prove that the shooting was justified.
IE, prove to the court that you didn't just go there to kill someone. Build your defense.
I support officers, but I also support accountability. And this sort of thing just stinks of shirking accountability.
All apart of the plan.
Yeah bullshit‚Ä¶ cops need to just accept it. 99.9% of the people they encounter carrying are not doing so with the intent of harming a cop.
Fuck these cowards!
This. I remember that same line getting rolled out for that officer that murdered Tamir Rice (12 y.o.). They‚Äôre decked out in kevlar, armed and normally have backup.
How much more does a potential threat have to be mitigated before police can be expected to use better judgement?
So if a cop just rolls up on a scene where someone happens to be armed, they can blast away and then ask questions later? Bullshit. He didn‚Äôt even try to defuse the situation, not even a ‚Äòdrop the gun‚Äô. He just opened fire. BTW, for anyone not familiar with the story, the cop was at the wrong apartment.
I did a google search for ‚Äúhomeowner shot by police‚Äù and you get an alarming number of stories about this happening all over the country.
It‚Äôs 100% unacceptable but we‚Äôre expecting the police to correct themselves, that just isn‚Äôt happening on any level. It‚Äôs going to take us threatening to vote politicians out of office who refuse to pass legislation forcing them to change the way they conduct themselves.
Guns have been in this country longer than our constitution has‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about time the government/law enforcement get in touch with reality. A man in his own home answering the door with a gun in hand, not pointed at anyone, shouldn‚Äôt be executed. He was well within his rights.
Not to mention, the left burned cities over George Floyd, a violent criminal addicted to dangerous drugs - where are they now, when an American black man (who served his country) was killed for trying to protect himself??? It‚Äôs sounding pretty quiet over on the left side of the spectrum
Its like they don't even care.
The cop was just wrong on this and should face consequences. Mr Fortson showed two clear signs of a non-threatening possession of a firearm holding it down towards the ground and holding his other hand up in the universal sign of "I am not threatening you".
It seems like a lot of sentient gun owners and conservatives are finally done with ‚ÄúBack the Blue‚Äù except the NRA and all the Fudds.
And in this case, allegedly, it's a complete and total failure of the current health care (specifically mental health) system. Guy was in a VA hospital for 2 weeks saying he heard voices telling him to kill people and they cut him loose!? How's that the fault of the average American gun owner?
‚ÄúBecause fuck you, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù -gun grabbers
It's not. It's simply a justification to disarm the populace, something every government wants to do. What we should be alarmed at are the useful idiots who think that collective guilt is a good thing.
They're all against collective punishment (see the copious opinions on gaza) until it's about gun control. Then suddenly collective punishment is all the rage.
If the uniparty didn't have double standards they wouldn't have any at all.
Despite all the lefties brigading in here: this is absolutely the issue. We fought a 20+ year war that has unknown mental and physical health side effects. Millions of vets at risk of various ailments. And the current VA scheme with Congress is to cut disability benefits and ‚Äústreamline‚Äù everything else.
I‚Äôm a firm believer and fighter for my healthcare and benefits - and I‚Äôm not even feeling encouraged anymore to work within the system. I know dozens of friends and family that are either abusing drugs, alcohol, or have already taken their life. I know just as many that see that as the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù for a VA patient and decide to just not go anywhere near it.
That is all just a small subset of a 360 million population - I can only imagine what the rest of the country is like in terms of mental health and access‚Ä¶ and then these smooth brain fucks want to argue that it is a gun problem while society is crumbling around them.
Good. He‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs not just the heart though. Mental health is the problem.
This is certainly the time to talk about legislation. Specifically, the laws in Maine that:
There was a cook at the Bar & Grill that tried to rush the gunman with a knife. The gunman killed him, but the employer should have civil liability for the fact that he didn't have a gun.
I dislike this. We need to address this as a mental health and professional competency crisis, not ignore it.
Maine shooter was previously known by police and peers to be mentally unstable, have stayed in mental health facility for 2 weeks, and explicitly stated he wanted to kill people.
Mental healthcare system failed, the police failed, and his peers failed. This was 100% preventable if people gave a single fuck.
When you live in a world that not only pretends that mental illness is something to be celebrated, mental illness will be rampant.
I said he would be good for us. Hate all u want
Trump is bad on the 2A but his judges have been good. Kamala is worse on the 2A and her judges will be even worse.
This^
Basically arguments about impact vs principle. Harris is bad in both.
With the way this Supreme Court has been doing things I‚Äôm just waiting for the day that they deem all gun laws unconstitutional
anyone who says Kamala is better is coping or trying to virtue stand for bots (the herd effect), escpially the bump stock vomit, and it‚Äôs cringe. i won‚Äôt say the sub name but you know‚Ä¶
giberalmanbunowners?
Mandatory Gun Buyback is a funny way to say confiscation.
This is true. The debate with Trump‚Äôs position ended with the primary. While I think he could be much better on the area, Kamala is absolutely worse.
In other news, water is wet.
He should‚Äôve replied with ‚Äòa Glock what?, what kind of Glock?‚Äô But no, it‚Äôs a rehearsed and scripted interview to make her look good. Mainstream media is a disgraceful sham.
I think the consensus is likely either a G17 or a G19, duty pistol from her time as a state AG. I doubt it's been fired in years personally tbh
I bet she has a G18.
One rule for the rulers, and one for the ruled.
Rules for thee but not for me
That‚Äôs gun control in a nutshell. The poors can‚Äôt have them 
So she claims to have a Glock and when asked why she claims she was in ‚Äúlaw enforcement‚Äù. So the same law enforcement that in almost every restricted state has exception made specially for them. She is desperately trying to appeal to gun owners with ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù and is failing miserably.
Can‚Äôt trust anything she says
She‚Äôs an idiot and a liar.
lol she has a Glock switch from aliexpress
To be fair, she also tried to ban all handguns and wants to ban all semiautomatic rifles.
Only the part of the law banning Colt AR15s by name. The rest of the law was upheld.
For those of us not in NJ, what was upheld?
Misleading
"The judge‚Äôs ruling was limited in scope ‚Äî it applies only to one type of firearm, the Colt AR-15"
lol what????
It's sh*tty weak ruling by a doofus judge; not enough spine to fully strike down an obviously bad law. Read it here: https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/new-jersey-ar-15-ban-unconstitutional.pdf
‚Äú all experience hath shewn (sic), that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.‚Äù
One day we‚Äôll get tired of the ruling class and do something about it.
No [sic] needed, shewn is a correct, if antiquated, spelling.
Now they get busy suing manufacturers. Smh
Crazy ruling. We need one of these AWB cases to come out of a circuit court and be a final ruling. Thomas basically said ‚Äúbring one of these to me and we will fix it‚Äù when they kicked the IL cases (those were not yet final). Could obviously take a while but there are so many of these, hopefully one will move forward soon.
Lmao colt sales just jumped in NJ
because democrats lie
See also, all other politicians.
Democrats love to rely on obfuscation that hides one‚Äôs preferences so that they don't need to be justified.
All politicians want us disarmed.
https://www.npr.org/2019/09/12/760386808/orourke-promises-to-take-your-ar-15-but-americans-are-split-on-buybacks
Biden said the same thing almost word for word after Uvalde.
Its not just the Dems. The sooner you realize that no one cares about you and just wants your votes the better off in life you will be. Donny said he would take your guns without due process, look into banning suppressors, and banned bump stocks.
Firearm Owners‚Äô Protection Act of 1986, banned new machine guns under the watch of Reagan. Also after Reagan was shot his views on gun control to be in favor of it. He was a supporter of the 1994 AWB. Reagan was also in charge when Undetectable Firearms Act was passed. It basically says that a firearm has to have so much metal in it so it can be detected.
There are several more you could really dive into but the point is that its not a R vs D issue, its a power issue, and the people that say they care about you owning a firearm, care about it because it gives them your votes. Don't be fooled into believing it goes beyond that.
It‚Äôs called lying.
Can't wait for a Bloomberg and/or Giffords slush fund org to twist these numbers by classifying adults as children and counting things like water gun shootings as gun violence
Pretty sure they count negligent discharges within a mile of school grounds as ‚Äúschool shootings‚Äù
If you count the year we closed down roads and increased crime by forcing people to not work, it‚Äôs actually still not the highest cause of death, but it‚Äôs close, so we‚Äôll say it is by picking the one group of ages that makes it so for 2020.
Signed, the gun banners, I mean scientists and stuff.
"School shooting" listings include incidents where someone called the cops because they THOUGHT they saw a gun even though nobody was injured, no suspect was identified, and no firearm was found. Others include "incidents" of a student showing a firearm to a friend in the parking lot. Still others involve violence between people who aren't students occurring outside of school hours that happens close-enough to school property. Of course, there are real school shootings, such as the three identified in this FBI report.
It also includes incidents where a gun was discharged nearby a school but not inside one. Like a person that lives next to a school shooting an intruder
Three is way too many. Gun Free zones seem to be the targets of these types of murderers. It takes a really sick person to put children in a scenario where no one can protect them if something goes wrong. Ban gun free zones.
Armed security guards in school, hold police accountable for cowardice and encourage teachers to CCW. Stop making schools fish in the barrel, it'll stop being the target of the mentally ill people they fail to act on. üôÑ
GVA recently changed their report title from "school shootings" to "school incidents" (the URL still uses the original name), but still a massive percentage of them involve 0 injuries and many don't occur on school grounds. Heck, this one from 3 weeks ago involved a non-functioning toy gun, and it still gets counted.
It has become a game of weaponized statistics.
Edit: And just to clarify, my quote above was sarcasm, but GVA definitely defines the term extremely loosely.
And two were by trans and quickly swept under the rug.
Ya, the criteria that any given researcher or entity uses in determining what constitutes a school shooting is pretty whack sometimes. What criteria did you use here to come to this determination? Thanks
Cool... now do the NFA., and Brady, and all the BS state level "scary black rifle" bans.
Thomas' opinion is logical, grounded in law, and unsurprising. It's interesting to note that he uses diagrams of AR-type actions to delve into the details of "function of the trigger." Hopefully, this is a tip of the hand regarding the Court's take on AWB laws, whose (un)Constitutionality remains a chafing legal question, given the deliberate slow-walks taken by several liberal-leaning Federal Circuits. Of course, any American capable of parsing basic English should already be able to ascertain that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear the most popular rifles and pistols sold in the US, but gun-grabbers keep insisting otherwise. I agree that the Court is overdue to resolve this question, hopefully with at least as solid a majority as Garland v. Cargill.
Can they please just take an AWB case for fucks sake.
Bump stocks are the Lamborghini/fiero kits of the firearms world. None of you bought them anyway
Not many did but we should have a choice to if we want.
The liberal dissenting judges stated "When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.‚Äù So are they admitting that same logic applies to men who want to be a woman?
Your logic doesn't work here.
They are calling not a machine gun a machine gun.
Thus, if you are saying that a trans woman is actualy a man, then the liberal justices would deem them truly a woman.
Bumpy Bois are back?
I watched the court arguments, if they only asked the simple question, "What happens when you shoot a rifle one handed; equipped with a bump-stock vs a full-auto rifle." This simple question would have saved countless hours and would have likely changed the dissenting justices into getting an unanimous decision.
You are mistakenly thinking their logic drives their conclusions.
In reality, their conclusions drive their choice of logic.
Boner alert
Don't point that thing at anything you don't intend to shoot.
Also, how can the government argue that machine guns "are not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes" when there are currently still plenty of machine guns owned by law abiding citizens and not being used in any crimes?
This is the big one. Silencers should be over the counter, no background check.
I‚Äôm so turned on right!
Now
I'm not holding my breath. As far as the courts are concerned, the Hughes Amendment is just a sales restriction. It doesn't prohibit anyone from keeping or bearing an M-16, it just prohibits selling a new one. The only legal precedent needed for such a sales restriction is the NFA, which has been on the books for almost 90 years. For the Hughes Amendment to be ruled unconstitutional, the NFA will have to be ruled unconstitutional first.
The courts have no problem with the NFA. Here's an excerpt from the D.C. v. Heller ruling which was directly quoted in the Bruen ruling.
"Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."
I'd love to be proven wrong about this, but it will be up to congress to repeal the Hughes Amendment.
This is a ban with extra steps.
Per Bruen, the NFA is way outside the allowed timeframe for the "text, history and tradition" test and cannot be used to claim precedence.
Stack up hoe
I‚Äôll happily let them buyback all of the guns they sold me! Every single one!
Yep. All zero of them.
Americans purchased two million ARs this month alone. The fuck is she blabbing about?
Her answer is a great reminder why we have 2A
Importation? 2,000,000? It‚Äôs almost like she has no idea what she‚Äôs talking about.
She knows the real numbers. But admitting that semi-automatic firearms are commonly owned paints her and her agenda into a corner, so best to just lie thru her teeth.
She and her ilk will never change the vote of any semi-conscious gun owner, so really she‚Äôs just speaking to her base.
It‚Äôs because they know they can‚Äôt just ban them or do an AWB by executive order. If they could, they would have years ago.
So what will happen is they‚Äôll push a whole raft of legislation. AWB, magazine limits, red flag laws, closing the ‚Äúgun show loophole‚Äù (that Dems specifically agreed to,) etc.
Then none of it will pass, and she‚Äôll issue an executive order with a few extremely tepid (but still infringing) changes, like banning the importation of certain guns. Which as you know, won‚Äôt do much at all.
Then declare victory.
Even if I bought guns from the Federal government, it would be irresponsible for me to sell them back knowing how they misuse them so irrationally. They are safer in my hands.
I‚Äôd like to be anyone but the LEOs that are mandated to enforce any sort of buyback in my area
So much for fact checking both sides during the debate
There was no fact checking for miss Harris.. why do you think that could be
They didn‚Äôt even try to hide their bias
Hopefully the electorate is smart enough to see through it‚Ä¶..oh shit we‚Äôre screwed
"Nobody's taking away your guns...you're going to give them to us. At gun point. See? Totally different."
Some of us are still willing to stand against tyranny even if it means we are killed.
Love how everyone I know and talk to that is mildly liberal keeps saying both Kamala and walz are gun owners and want to keep all our rights. Lol
Correct them. Point out they‚Äôre the most anti-gun candidates we‚Äôve ever had in history. Do not let them continue to lie.
Dude, I have had so many people try to pretend Kamala won‚Äôt impose gun control or disarm anyone when SHE HAS AN ASSAULT WEAPON BAN ON HER EFFING PLATFORM. Some idiot was like ‚Äúoh, well taking assault rifles isn‚Äôt disarming.‚Äù like what the actual fuck. I can have a gun one day in the next day I can‚Äôt. That is disarming.
Her website says
"As President, she won‚Äôt stop fighting so that Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship. She‚Äôll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require universal background checks, and support red flag laws that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. She will also continue to invest in funding law enforcement, including the hiring and training of officers and people to support them, and will build upon proven gun violence prevention programs that have helped reduce violent crime throughout the country."
No democrat has ever been this upfront about their radical anti-gun agenda. This is disgusting.
I've already had to b& a few folks and have removed a lot of nonsensical or offtopic/unproductive political topics.
You wanna talk about the topic at hand, or the 2A, have at it.
You want to talk politics - there are a million other places on reddit to do so - go have your fun somewhere else.
Crazy how all the users on liberalgunowners are saying its a false flag and how they need to organize and get prepared
Prepared for what? Has there been uprisings and unrest? Like in the blue cities when they don‚Äôt get what they want?
Fuck that piece of shit. Thank god Trump was not killed or seriously wounded. Prayers to those that were hurt or killed, except for the shooter rest in hell mother fucker.
Seriously, dude missed a GIGANTIC head at 125 yards with no wind.
This really the final nail in the coffin of the "you don't need a red dot, irons are good enough" debate.
I keep hearing that the shot was between 140 and 150 yards or so, and it just makes me glad that that guy clearly wasn't a deer hunter.
I'm just tired of all the people who have made loving or hating Trump their entire personality. It's like seeing the end result of an 8 year long edging session.
I might be in the minority here but I think people are getting too caught up in the political affiliation of the shooter. Obviously 99.9% of ppl on either side aren‚Äôt crazy or stupid enough to try something like this. If he was a Republican I‚Äôd call him an unhinged unamerican mentally deranged psychopath and I‚Äôd say the exact same thing if he was a registered Democrat. Lunacy is prevalent anywhere.
Yeah‚Ä¶ As one of the (possibly?) few leftists on this sub in earnest, I‚Äôm glad to see the mod team taking a hard stance on this. The last thing we need is more violence and actions like this should be condemned unilaterally. No love lost for Trump from me, but violence is not the answer.
It seriously blows my mind how people are mad about this. They WANT unelected bureaucrats to have complete control of their lives. They want them to make up rules on shit without going through congress cause they're the "experts". Yeah, the experts like the ATF who don't know how to disassemble a glock or file paperwork in a proper manner without holding up everything else behind it. Or EPA experts who ruin millions of lives off a random rule they make up
They're only mad about it because "their side" is currently in charge of those bureaucratic agencies.
I guarantee you if the NRA was a part of the government instead of the ATF, those same people would be celebrating in the streets over this ruling.
This ain‚Äôt even only a pro gun thing. Massive win for the American people.
3 letter agencies shouldn‚Äôt be dictating laws, that‚Äôs why we elect politicians.
Nonsense. I‚Äôve been assured by this sub many times that republicans are just as bad as democrats on 2A rights, and therefore SCOTUS appointments don‚Äôt matter.
I mean, it‚Äôs almost like there IS a difference, in fact a huge one, and that SCOTUS appointments DO matter.
/S
Yeah who nominated the consistent 3 who vote against liberty every. Single. Time?
And at the state level. How are gun rights in blue states vs red? Utah and Missouri and Tennessee vs New Jersey, Hawaii and California? No difference there either?
After rahimi, this victory is a relief. This is huge for liberty, on all levels.
Rahimi is a backhanded victory.
They said temporary disarmament is OK.
Can someone ELI5 on this one? I am still not totally understanding the cheveron thing.
Chevron deference meant that government agencies could make regulations. Think EPA. Now, ATF can only enforce laws already on the books, and in order to change a law Congress will have to be involved.
Sounds like he knows something is about to go down
When that shitlib in Congress was talking about bringing back the draft a few months ago (and the changes got rammed through in mere days) I knew something was up.
The bipartisan golf course is busy lately!
I don‚Äôt even know my neighbors‚Äô names much less are we friends.
I do know their gardeners start their leaf blowers religiously at 7 AM every Thursday, though.
Based
I couldn't agree more, exactly what I do. We are 80% good friends and I know approximately the amount of firepower (a lot) on the block.
It's a nice feeling. I pity the fool who tries to cause trouble on my block.
Because reddit censors ZH here is the archived link from which the video is taken. It provides more context:
https://archive.is/MlK0E
You want to keep crime in your area out? This is the way, keeping an eye out for each other is the best deterrent. Familiarizing yourself with your neighbors and who comes to visit regularly and such. Best thing is when a neighbor knows you are out of town or not home and he calls you to let you know a car he doesn‚Äôt recognize is at your house. Bust them burglars on the spot and makes sure the criminals know they can‚Äôt come back to that area because they will be made out.
We have a neighbor at the end of our street who works from home. Every single time he's seen a vehicle pull into our driveway he doesn't recognize or something he sees that isn't normal he calls us and pulls the pics off his security cameras in case we find shit has been fucked with. Even wild animals or odd happenings in town, he'll give us a shout and heads up to what's going on.
He's a little socially awkward but a really nice guy and is a treasure trove of wilderness survival and bushcraft knowledge and will talk your ear off with anything you want to know. He's told me all sorts of random cool facts about the land around our house and things to look out for that can help you immensely or can ruin your day if you're careless about it.
Democrats brand him as a dangerous extremist advocating militia violence
We‚Äôre fucked.
My family is so paranoid that they won‚Äôt even speak to someone through the ring camera in fear of them somehow harming them. Someone‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs iPhone was saying it was at our house. I spoke to them, they left, then apparently came back and rang the doorbell when I was sleep.
My sister and my mom can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend that people talk to other people and don‚Äôt default to calling the cops because someone is at the front door. I tried explaining that maybe these people came back to let me/us know they found the phone and everything is fine.
Nope. My mom mentioned something she saw on the news or social media about some scam, my sister doesn‚Äôt think it makes sense to go and speak to to someone after you had initially seemingly accused them of taking something of yours. They also don‚Äôt consider them neighbors because they don‚Äôt live on the same street and their yard doesn‚Äôt connect with ours in anyway. But they live close enough to warrant a quick walk twice in a day.
My point is we have all this technology that connects us to the entire world but we‚Äôve lost connection to those in our actual communities. I‚Äôm being looked at as some weirdo for saying we should speak to people.
The real question is how is it that an "agency" who does not have the ability to create laws, creates it's own "rules" that oppress law abiding citizens and can enforce their made up rules by force, at will, bypassing and usurping constitutional rights and already existing law?
"Because fuck you, that's why" - the ATF, probably
Right! The deep state is unconstitutional. It‚Äôs because SCOTUS ruled in favor of the EPA in Chevron years ago. Look for them to correct that soon.
This should be asked about all of the alphabet agencies, not just the bureau of Assholes,Tyranny, and Fuckery
Because congress figured out long ago that actually making laws was pretty unpopular and they could be held accountable for those laws. It also took away precious time campaigning and asking for money to enrich themselves. So they delegated their authority and their responsibilities to agencies. Then they took extra special care to make sure that those agencies were completely unaccountable for their actions.
Yeah they are. Good. Should be 50.
Inb4 dismissed for "standing"
They should sue the ATF for taxing a right whenever someone wants a muffler or shorter barrel
Our lame duck Maine governor is about to sign just such a law.
(Full article because fuck MSN and their annoying aggregator)
A total of 26 Republican states filed three separate lawsuits against the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the corresponding leaders, over the Biden administration‚Äôs new gun-control rule that will regulate the private selling and purchasing of firearms.
Each federal lawsuit, filed Wednesday, argues the ATF rule violates the Second Amendment by placing undue gun restrictions on American citizens. According to the rule, any person who sells a gun for profit to anyone else, including family members, would be considered ‚Äúengaged in the business‚Äù of dealing in firearms. Therefore, a private seller would be required to obtain a federal firearms license and conduct a background check before making a transaction. Those who violate the rule‚Äôs provisions would be considered felons.
Kansas attorney general Kris Kobach and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton led two multistate lawsuits, while Florida attorney general Ashley Moody filed her own.
‚ÄúUntil now, those who repetitively purchased and sold firearms as a regular course of business had to become a licensee,‚Äù the Kansas-led court filing reads. ‚ÄúThis rule would put innocent firearm sales between law-abiding friends and family members within reach of federal regulation.
‚ÄúSuch innocent sales between friends and family would constitute a felony if the seller did not in fact obtain a federal firearms license and perform a background check,‚Äù it adds.
In all three lawsuits, the listed Republican attorneys general argue the rule is unconstitutional because it circumvents Congress.
In 2022, Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to, in part, expand the background-check system for gun sellers. President Joe Biden signed the gun-control legislation into law to crack down on gun violence in the U.S., and has since called for Congress to pass stricter legislation requiring universal background checks. Congress has repeatedly declined to do so, but Biden signed an executive order last year directing U.S. attorney general Merrick Garland to move as close to universal background checks as possible.
This resulted in the creation of the ATF rule, which expands upon the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act‚Äôs modified definition of ‚Äúengaged in the business‚Äù of selling guns, meaning anyone can be classified as a firearms dealer if they have the intent to ‚Äúpredominantly earn a profit.‚Äù The lawsuits say this updated definition extends beyond the scope of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which exempts individuals who occasionally engage in firearm transactions.
‚ÄúThe challenged rule, in fact, goes far beyond the plain text of the BSCA,‚Äù Florida‚Äôs suit states. ‚ÄúIt purports to force thousands of law-abiding gun owners to register as federal firearms dealers and navigate a federal bureaucracy as a precondition to engaging in constitutionally protected activity.‚Äù
Last month, the DOJ submitted the final version of the rule, ‚ÄúDefinition of ‚ÄòEngaged in the Business‚Äô as a Dealer in Firearms,‚Äù to the Federal Register. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on April 19 and will go into effect on May 20.
‚ÄúThis Court‚Äôs action is necessary on an urgent basis because, contrary to past practice, Defendants have accelerated the effective date of their latest edict to a mere 30 days from publication in the Federal Register, in an attempt to circumvent timely judicial review,‚Äù the Texas-led lawsuit says.
All 26 states urge the courts to rule that the ATF rule is unlawful and permanently enjoin the defendants from implementing it.
Kansas was joined by 20 other states: Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The Texas coalition includes Louisiana, Mississippi, and Utah. Gun-rights advocacy groups representing gun owners serve as co-plaintiffs in the suits filed by Kansas and Texas, and Florida was the sole plaintiff in its own litigation against the ATF, DOJ, and their heads.
Yep. Make no mistake: There is no "middle ground" here that they will accept. They will continue to chip away at the 2A every little bit they can until they can repeal it outright. Any politician who starts with "I support the 2A but..." does NOT support the 2A.
They've been doing that for almost 100 years now. No reason to expect that will ever change.
I WANT MY (WHOLE) PIE BACK!
Weird, it started with "We aren't coming after semi-automatics, we just want to ban full autos" and now look where we're at lol
A rep in MA submitted a bill to ban semi autos that literally works by editing the state's existing "assault weapon ban" to replace the words "assault weapon" with "any rifle or shotgun containing a semiautomatic mechanism."
...just in case anyone requests an example of the so-called "slippery slope" in action.
Damn straight. The slippery slope began with the Firearms Control Act of 1934.
You mean those high powered, sniper style rifles? Why would anyone need a rifle with a heavy barrel, precision bolt, and high magnification scope? No one needs to be able to kill someone from 150+ yards away. Only military snipers should ever have that capability.
"We banned ar15s because they were so powerful - but these are even more powerful! Clearly they need to be banned too"
Better to have it and not need it than to not have it and need it. Your uncle can fuck off, and you should tell him that since he‚Äôs literally in your own home complaining. Rude
‚ÄúNo one needs a high powered rifle‚Äù ‚Äúthat scope makes it a sniper rifle‚Äù ‚Äúif it can kill a deer, it can kill a person‚Äù ‚Äú.308 is a military grade sniper bullet.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat weapon is capable of killing someone from over a mile away.‚Äù
It will be every shit take you can think of and more, they will never stop, they will never concede. The side that wants to be left alone will always be conquered by the side that wants to win. Not another inch.
*anti constitution FTFY
She wrote an amicus brief when she was the California AG in Heller arguing that there is no private right to own firearms.
She was instrumental in the formation of the CA pistol roster.
At least crazy uncle joe is fine with shotguns /eyeroll
Not that we don‚Äôt need to worry, BUT
Everything she‚Äôs said she would do, the Biden Harris campaign also said she‚Äôd do in 2020.
Her campaign said in 2020 if Congress didn‚Äôt pass an AWB (and other stuff) in 100 days, she‚Äôd do executive orders to pass what she could, which basically amounts to people who do over 5 private transactions in a year having to register as FFL‚Äôs. I think it‚Äôs a year, may be a month.
That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all she can pass by executive order. If they could do more, they would have under Obama or Biden.
I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt worry. Absolutely worry. But the best thing we can do is get better GOP candidates on tickets.
Having better candidates would be cool but seperating democrat funding from companies obsessed with gun control would be even better.
Next election. Right now we are stuck with a choice between the guy who appointed 3 supreme court justices and lower court appointments that favor the 2nd amendment, and Kamala Harris who advocated for gun confiscation.
The choice seems pretty obvious.
Is the Kamala astroturfing done? Seeing more articles like this in my feed now.
It's interesting how they're trying to completely restructure the Supreme Court just before electing the most anti-gun president in history. I'm sure these two things aren't related at all.
All the more reason to vote down ballot so as to deny her the congress and senate that would be required to enact such things.
I mean, those are great promises and all. What's he say about his bump-stock ban?
When it comes to firearms Republicans have two real bad habits:
(1) They compromise our rights away. Democrats will propose more gun control and Republicans will "compromise" and then claim the results as a victory because "It could have been worse!"
(2) They won't actually propose legislation expanding gun rights. They claim to protect/preserve gun rights simply because they refrain from attacking them. That's like your neighbor claiming that he's keeping your house safe simply because he's not personally breaking into it and robbing you.
I hate that you‚Äôre right, but that‚Äôs the truth.
Republicans did a closed door meeting with Dems after Uvalde and mentioned AWB‚Äôs were a nonstarter, but gave us the shit happening now‚Ä¶ time to accept that republicans just use the ‚Äúwhite flag‚Äù as their first phase of negotiations.
in other words: republicans are spineless, and the Overton window is shifting.
They need the threat of gun control to drive voter turnout.
Need rights to always be in jeopardy.
Trump is not pro gun. At best he‚Äôs ambivalent.
Dude is a rat Yorker ex Democrat who eats well done steak with ketchup. Ofc he isn't pro gun.
‚ÄúTake the guns first, due process 2nd‚Äù
At the same one cannot ignore all the pro2a judges he put into positions. So much so 4 corners diner‚Äôs mark smith calls him the most pro 2a president within the last 150 years.
Those folks doing 12 years for 2 bullets in turks and Caicos(a British territory) would be freed with a single phone call from trump. While biden lets them rot in prison. While he happily trades the ‚ÄúLord of war‚Äù for lesbian WNBA player who brought weed to russia after being told not to.
Idk why trump wouldn‚Äôt close the ATF all together.
How about just disband the ATF, coward. That would get my vote.
While I don't think Trump is great on guns he's wayyyyy better than Biden
Now come out and say you'll repeall the NFA/GCA and ill trust you
Just a circle jerk to get some more funding before he goes down in flames.
Some animals are more equal than others
Is that animal farm reference kosher?
What fucking reason does a US state governor have to be over there to begin with?
Probably so she can say she has seen the effects of war and we really shouldn't let anyone have ar-15
The fact that people in New York didn't start an insurrection over the ban of body armor astounds me. The state is literally making you as easy to kill as possible. It goes beyond bullshit "gun control" and gets into oppressing even more fundamental liberties. Not only cannot you not defend yourself with a firearm in many parts of the state, but now you are an easy kill for the rampant thugs that inhabit NYC or the ATF. Your life isn't even worth the cost of extra bullets. Try passing that here in Texas and let's see how it goes. I will go down swinging/firing.
I am absolutely shocked.
It‚Äôs good to be a member of the Ruling Class (TM)!
She`ll validate her wearing body armor by calling Israel a warzone.
What a hypocrite.
She isn't a hypocrite. She knows what body armor is for, that's exactly why she doesn't want YOU to have it, so it's easier to kill you. For example, "I support 2A, but I absolutely do not agree my enemies should have guns", it is a very consistent logical position.
All government officials are your enemy. It's really that simple. Maybe stop treating them like celebrities.
"youths" is usually European for "migrants from the Middle East and Africa", so probably not Swedish people.
I just assume at this point.
This is why Sweden stopped recording the country of origin and race of criminals
Sweden is fucked. I was watching a show about their customs and border patrol.
Busted a dude with 2 cartons of cigarettes, mostly for taxes, mostly boasted how they prevented them "possibly being sold to children"
Caught a kid with 1.1 grams of cocaine, patted themselves on the back and acted like they just single handedly crippled the Sinaloa cartel.
Some guy didnt pay VAT for a rolex, they treated him like a murderer "its imperative to national security the government collects taxes on luxury goods"
Took a womans mangos and acted like they just stopped a massive cholera outbreak.
Oh but lets let in every single "refugee" we can possibly cram through the gates.
It‚Äôll be our reality too with an unchecked border, stay strapped.
I live in Texas. You bet your ass I‚Äôm strapped 24/7.
Most victims of violent crime are unarmed and unarmed because of gun control.
Gun control is the problem not the solution.
I guess Sweden might not have [the answer to America‚Äôs gun problem] (https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12351824/gun-control-sweden-solution) after all.
I guess those shooters were some of the "responsible" Swedes that are allowed to own guns.
I hate "youths"
Hell no. I did not just fall out of a coconut tree like her supporters.
I don‚Äôt believe a single thing she says.
I believe her when she says:
If she is pro gun then I am the king of England
Can you knight me and grant me a dukedom?
The democratic nominee......for president.......saying she is pro-gun.
That's a good one. I needed that laugh this morning.
It is ridiculous that she can say "we're not taking anyone's guns away, but we need an assault weapon ban."
Even in the light most favorable to that position, she really needs to clarify, because it appears contradictory on its face.
Is she trying to say "we're not going to take ALL of your guns away, just the assault weapons?" is she trying to say "the assault weapon ban will grandfather in all the extant assault weapons like the 1994 ban did?"
One would hope that there is an actual explanation for this discrepancy and not just "saying whatever I want to matter what it means" (even though we know that's the case).
That‚Äôs a typical anti-gunner play. They always say they‚Äôre not taking away when they are. They always say that they support gun ownership but then add multiple layers of caveats.
She‚Äôs just trying to broaden her voter base at this point...she‚Äôll say anything to gain support but will talk out the side of her mouth when doing it.
Uhm‚Ä¶ no. She‚Äôs already shown her colors on that one.
I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs even a real human being. She‚Äôs just an actress delivering lines.
