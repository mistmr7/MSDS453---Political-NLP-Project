It‚Äôs sad to me that we‚Äôve managed to lose our ability to understand context and discern meaning if it means we think we can use it against the other side? This is 100% what Trump is saying‚Ä¶just vote this time and I‚Äôll make things do good that you won‚Äôt feel the need to vote in the future. I‚Äôll fix all the things you guys want fixed.
People are all ‚Äúoh he said the quiet part out loud!!!!‚Äù Cmon. He‚Äôs a salesman. He was selling these Christians a vision of a perfect Christian America where they get everything they want. Plain and simple.

I took it to mean that this is the last election he is running in, so it will be the last time he asks them to come out to vote for him
The brigading here is crazy. You have your answers to better understand Trump supports and you knew what the answer would be
This is what I was thinking. They asked a question and didn't like the answer so they downvoted.







It means nothing. People worked for him in the past, and unless they're looking for that in the future, they don't need to endorse him.
Does it look good if they do? Sure, I guess, but the last thing on Trump's list of things to do is to get his former employees to endorse him...




Does it concern you when he says at his rally he doesn't care about you, that he just needs you for your vote?

That number is months old (so the recent viral tweet calling it ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù is literally fake news), from before Trump had been declared the presumptive nominee, and it was wrong even then when I counted at least eight:
The number has only gone up since then (Nikki Haley for example), and will continue to. The convention isn‚Äôt until next month.
Edit: Actually, let‚Äôs try to count the ones since then‚Ä¶


















People age differently. This is an objective fact. There are some people that experience cognitive decline at 85, and there are cases at 45.
It was never about actual age. It was about mental decline.
Age can be a factor but not a determining factor. Biden showed/shows signs of mental decline.
Age isn‚Äôt the issue. Cognitive ability is. Sometimes cognitive ability declines with age, but not always. Bernie Sanders, for example, is as sharp as he‚Äôs ever been. Chronological age isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs important. Dementia can affect people even in their 50‚Äôs and in rare cases even younger than that.
Trump certainly has some flaws: he‚Äôs brash, he speaks his mind unfiltered, he‚Äôs a bit ‚ÄúADD‚Äù when he talks, he can be a bit of a jokester or even a troll at times. But these things, as best as I can tell, are still at his long term baseline. His speeches now seem unchanged to me from the 2016 campaign, and even from his talks and interviews and things way before that, going back decades.
Biden is not at his baseline. There is a clear and definitive cognitive decline when you compare videos from his vice presidency to the recent debate, or even from 2019/2020 to recent appearances. He can still have good moments, but he has a lot more bad moments now than he used to. Even in 2019/2020 he was displaying some early signs (anger/aggression at voters, forgetting the Declaration of Independence) but these were minor compared to what happened at the debate. But comparing Biden 2024 to Senator Biden is not even a comparison. It‚Äôs not the same guy. Senator Biden was well spoken, sharp af, tough but fair. A guy I‚Äôd almost consider voting for if he had the right policies. I wouldn‚Äôt vote for 2024 Biden even if he converted to the exact Trump platform. He‚Äôs too far gone.
Mitch McConnell is another example of someone too far gone. He‚Äôs having full on mini-strokes during speeches. Time to go Mitch.
But these things have nothing to do with chronological age. The issue is if they can still function at baseline or not.
I think every single candidate for Federal office of any age should have to take a live on camera MOCA to screen for dementia. Problem solved.
Age was not the issue. He was starting to lose his mind
It is concerning. I wish he weren't so old. But he doesn't have the same mental incapacity that Biden does.
Everyone knew Biden's age but it was Biden's mental abilities revealed at the debate that got him kicked off the ticket.
What's really concerning is Kamala and media were covering it up.
















He's lying now, he knows (probably kinda vaguely tbh) who/what it is. Project 2025 is home to a lot of the Trump loyalists, like John McEntee who have been around the scene for a long time. What's going on right now is a battle for control of the incoming Trump admin between a kind of new national conservative type machine that is more interested in folding MAGA energy back into the GOP (a slightly better GOP tbf, but only slightly) than about real and meaningful right wing reform. Project 2025 coming surprisingly out of a very stodgy place like Heritage is one of the better conservative infrastructure building projects that I've seen in recent years with an eye towards more than pure grift and bullshit. The key piece isn't the policy paper that everyone whines about but the personnel database to be used for hiring so that a MAGA agenda actually has a shot at becoming real (MAGA 2015 more than 2020/2024 tbh). The creatures in Trump world connected more to the donors and money now increasingly backing Trump from Wall Street and Silicon Valley see it as toxic, I'm sure.
It's unfortunate, but Trump is fickle and it could change.
edit: u/Bernie__Spamders makes a good point. Doesn't change much of what I said but the question is framed to suggest a thing that isn't true or at least not demonstrated in the body.
There are multiple possibilities:
4. The question is based on a false premise, like usual, and there isn't actually a video in which Trump endorses Project 2025. (It's this one)



















https://homeland.house.gov/2024/10/04/chairman-green-on-secretary-mayorkas-claims-about-fema-funds-biden-harris-administrations-priorities-are-completely-backwards/
They did not want to fund any additional illegal invaders being facilitated by Biden/Harris/Mayorkas.
I'm annoyed that Ukraine just got billions of our taxpayer money (again) for their quagmire of a war when FEMA is strapped for cash. Stop spending extra money, just keep that money out of Ukraine's hands and in FEMA's.



FEMA bills should have literally zero dollars for immigrants put in them. Only pass bills that benefit the protection of natural born Americans.



Do you think it‚Äôs possible that helping illegal immigrants could also help Americans? For example if an illegal immigrant‚Äôs house is on fire, it helps Americans to put it out so the fire doesn‚Äôt spread?












I think you should examine the transactions but it's nowhere near close to as important as Bidens. Trump handed his businesses off to his children when he became president. He wasn't in charge and had no business in his business. Trump lost money during his presidency, the only one ever. So I mean if you want to examine go ahead. It's good to look into dealing with our elected officials no matter the party. That's how you keep this country from being corrupt. The problem is it's all focused towards the Republicans and or Trump. Nobody cares to even examine anything the Democrats do. Biden's foreign payments are a lot different and more important. Trump has a business, that is designed to make money of course. What business does Biden have to even give any justifiable reason as to why he is accepting money? Biden is not even a businessman! If there is no justifiable evidence that would make sense of foreign money, that needs looking at 100%! Hunter has no credentials to work on the board of Burisma. In fact, he is a known crackhead! Bidens foreign money needs and deserves a lot more attention than it gets. It's clear corruption and it's cost lives, bro. It's not just money. There is no coincidence that Ukraine is in a war right now. If these allegations were taken more seriously sooner, Ukrainian and Russian lives wouldn't be dead. So no I do not agree that Trump's foreign money needs to be looked at as much as Biden's. Trump has an acceptable reason for it to begin with. Biden has no reason at all. Trump's foreign money hasn't cost people their lives and has not sold America out. Bidens has and it took away your own taxpayers money to aid Ukraine in a war that shouldn't have ever happened. This war would have never started if Bidens and other nato nations leaders stopped what they were doing and negotiated with Putin. Putin gave them a warning and all we had to do was talk it out. But we declined to do so. All Putin wanted was at least a neutral Ukraine. Ukraine not to join NATO. Ukraine wants to become part of NATO and paid Biden for it with bribes costing innocent people their lives and livelihoods. Trump's foreign money that was made by his kids is hardly as important nor impacted any of our lives compared to Biden's corruption! Biden's corruption has ended lives, created food shortages, taken away your taxpayer's money that could have been used for Lahaina, destroyed entire countries with war, created Ukrainian refugees, may bring us to WW3, made gas prices rise, the possibility of a Taiwan invasion from China, created the Wagner group, and pushed a lot of the world towards BRICS. An organization to get rid of the US dollar's power. If you think Trump's foreign money is the problem. You just hate Trump 100%. During his presidency, gas prices were low, no new wars, we were respected as nation, feared as a nation, unemployment was low, nothing to bring us to WW3, a good economy, a stronger military, etc. There is no implication that other governments paid to get their way at all. If they did hell they made America better? ü§£ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è There was no selling out America during Trump's administration. Sure as hell was in Biden's. America has only got worse because of Biden. Bidens will result in treason which is punishable by death. Trumps is only enough to get into a court for it to be struck down as nothing like everything else thrown against him. It's time to wake up and quit making your political allegiance how you vote. Voting for Trump in today's time is something that should be seen as nonpartisan. Because Biden is 100% no good for America. He is a sellout and a traitor to our nation and there is no doubt about that.













Okay, if you can‚Äôt manage/prepare for safe conditions at a small town hall event, should you and your team be trusted with the entire country?


I hate that I agree with y'all but I do. It was wholly appropriate to stop the event. Do these folks not remember dragging Travis Scott through the muck when he didn't stop his concert for a medical emergency? And once that happens it's kinda hard to get back into a "rally" mood.















I'd like to note that the submission was approved largely because OP clearly demonstrated a genuine desire to understand in the post body, as well as in modmail.
Written tone matters and a good one goes a long way.











Because ‚ÄúGet Trump No Matter What‚Äù seems to be the motto the last 8 years. Like when FBI agent Peter Strzok overseeing Trump‚Äôs investigation text he would ‚ÄúStop Trump (from becoming president)‚Äù.
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/fbi-texts-trump.html
Or the huge Russian collusion and election interference scandal that turned out to be fake.
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/05/17/durham-report-vindicates-trump-fbi-russia-investigation/70222344007/
These ‚Äúboy that cried wolf‚Äù scenarios obviously makes the public lose faith when the media announces yet another crime that Trump is accused of.
You also have the 30+ year history of mostly positive media coverage of Trump before he ran for office. He was popular enough to cameo in movies, be on talk shows, everyone wanted a photo with him, and be mentioned positively in songs. He even starred on his own hit TV show for 14 seasons, which is a long time for one person to stay relevant on TV.
So many Americans did not trust the media when it suddenly flipped on Trump the months leading up to the 2016 election.





There is definitely a double standard.
Like when trump takes out a loan pays it back with interest, it‚Äôs a crime. But then you take out a student loan, don‚Äôt pay it back so Biden steals the money from taxpayers to pay it back and this is not a crime.
Here‚Äôs a nice summary of the double standard
https://x.com/not_the_bee/status/1825575038764069242?s=46






















Is bipartisan support a good thing?
Bush, McCain, Romney are all pro war neocons. Of course they will break toward Democrats.
People who worked for candidates that I don‚Äôt like or agree with support someone else I don‚Äôt like or agree with. Doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.










If anything, this works for me as a promotion for Trump. Those men are the reason Trump is so appealing.
If Bush's people don't like you, that's a glowing endorsement in my book. You can keep your Dick Cheney warmongers thank you very much.
I am generally pleased to see the mask off moment where we see both parties' traditional candidates are just different shades of neocons. There was very little difference between Bush and Obama in policy terms, especially foreign policy, that's a big reason we have Trump today.
It matters just about as much as those 50 intelligence agency members who claimed that the Hunter laptop was Russian Disinformation which was exposed to be a total lie, which is hilarious considering the left wing subs were posting that shit non stop back then and they had no clue it was a total lie. Most of you Democrats and NSers still don't understand how deep the swamp is. These people are so embedded in Washington and politics that they can find 50 of their friends to lie for them and sign an official note claiming it's Russian disinformation.
I have a counter question, does it matter to you that Democrats of the past, even high profile Democrats of the past such as RFK and Tulsi Gabbard have abandoned the Democrat party due to it's radicalism, does that matter to you?
The election of Trump in 2016 marked a directional shift in the republican party away from foreign wars, big spending, corporate influence, and serving elites and brought the focus back to America and it's people, as well as exposing the corruption in government that has emerged in time prior to Trump. I realize you may disagree with that statement, but that is generally why Trump has the support he has. So when you mention old-guard republicans, who helped set the prior direction in place, who helped to foster the corruption that emerged during their reign, it is of no surprise and of no consequence to me that they do not support a movement away from that direction. If anything, it reinforces my support.
Nope. Endorse whomever you want. There's always been a contingent of never Trump Republicans.
It doesn‚Äôt raise any red flags for so many of his former appointees, especially his Vice President, to warn people against voting for him? I get that right wing media, and Trump himself, has done a wonderful job of demonizing any Republican that disagrees with Trump, but‚Ä¶
There‚Äôs this saying I‚Äôd heard somewhere:
Nope!!







I mean, I‚Äôm not gonna go through all of them but looking at the first one he said ‚Äúi think our country is in the most dangerous position it‚Äôs ever been in from an economic standpoint‚Äù
Because he started with ‚ÄúI think‚Äù it was clear that was an opinion. And i assume he provided reasons after that that NPR conveniently left out although I didn‚Äôt listen to the full press conference.
And it seems reasonable to say that anyway with sky high inflation and the fact that the fed is likely to lower interest rates within the next few months after a two-year-long yield curve inversion.
These are not fact checks as much as journalists disagreeing with Trump‚Äôs opinions while claiming that their opinions are ‚Äúofficial facts.‚Äù Which in many circles of society is considered lying bullshit propaganda.
I read the first 20 or so. A lot of these are opinions, and the fact check consists of them basically saying "we disagree" (see 6 and 7 for the worst [best?] examples of this). 25 is particularly funny.
Trump: "She can't do an interview. She's barely competent and she can't do an interview.‚Äù
"Fact check": Harris hasn‚Äôt done interviews since getting into the campaign, but she has done them in the past, so saying ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt do‚Äù one or that she is ‚Äúbarely competent‚Äù are just insults. Trump tends to revert to questioning the intelligence of Black women who challenge him. In fact, Trump did it nine times in this news conference, saying either Harris is not that ‚Äúsmart‚Äù (five times) "incompetent‚Äù (three times) or ‚Äúbarely competent,‚Äù as he did here.
Lol not surprising at all they reverted to saying he insults the intelligence of "Black Women" who challenge him specifically when it's really anyone that challenges him.

Since NPR are proven liars when it comes to matters involving Trump or the Left's corruption, I don't give them the time of day. If they wanted my attention, they shouldn't be liars.
The moment they called Biden's corruption with the Ukraine prosecutor a "conspiracy theory", when there was video at the time of him admitting he did it, I never bothered with them again. I can listen to Leftist propaganda from any MSM news outlet. They should be defunded, I don't care what % it represents. It should be 0%.
This reads like a Babylon bee article
‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre very close to a world war. In my opinion, we‚Äôre very close to a world war.‚Äù
Fact check by NPR: false? When did we start fact checking opinion? What a terrible piece of journalism.
It‚Äôs an opinion piece, and I disagree with most of the opinions. The issue is with the articles labeling. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúanalysis.‚Äù
The authors don‚Äôt like Trump and are sharing, in 90% of their ‚Äúfact-checks‚Äù, opinions that disagree with his. That‚Äôs their right, just call it what it is.

















His border policy is his most clear failure. Somewhere between 7-10 million people have came through since he took office and we have no idea who a lot of them are or where they came from.
He shouldn‚Äôt have ended the remain in Mexico policy.
How could he of continued it if it was tied to the covid emergency? Once that ended it ended

Are you aware that the Biden administration was trying to pass a comprehensive border bill but Trump had all of his Republican buddies vote it down to keep Biden from getting a "win"?
Do you think Trump's "solution" of increased tariffs on imported goods will do anything to reduce inflation?































He's pointing out (rightly) that she is being referred to as black (when she identified as Indian before, but now its suddenly different?). I have yet to see her correct the record when available data points to her Indian/Irish ancestry (she also confirmed this repeatedly). Reports also highlight some eyebrow raising ancestors, as well. Is it the most important thing ever? No, but folks keep mentioning her skin color as if she is black & that is a major selling point. So, I certainly don't blame Trump for this.














Why is Trump willing to declassify the Epstein files ("I guess I would") but Joe Biden (who could do this today) is not?
I'm guessing it is not a good idea to make a bunch of perverted billionaires angry, or you might just get Epstein'd.

I'm confused by OPs title question because he said he would declassify them.
You suspiciously cut the quote short. He continues: "... if it's phony stuff in there cause there's a lot of phony stuff in that whole world."
Seems like a reasonable statement to me.
Define "enormous number". There are photos of them together simply by virtue of occasionally attending the same social gatherings, which isn't cause for concern.
Also... "friends for years"? Where do you get this idea? My understanding is that they were not friends at all. Trump explicitly stated he didn't like him shortly after they met.
he said yes but by all means don't let that stand in your way




This was covered a long time ago when the flight logs were released: there were a lot of victims, and they‚Äôre all adult women now with new lives, many with husbands and children. They don‚Äôt want all the people in their new lives to know what happened to them when they were children. So I get what he‚Äôs saying when he says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want to affect people‚Äôs lives‚Ä¶.‚Äù















He should've brought up the fact that kamala didn't answer the question multiple times. The answer to the question of whether people are better off than 4 years ago is a simple "no", not long winded more freebies that's just going to add to inflation. A $25k government payment for down payment is just going to inflate the price of house by $25k, leaving those who qualify to be in similar situation without it while screwing others who don't qualify.
It was painful to watch. The ABC moderators be-clowned themselves with obvious bias - felt like 3 on 1 debate, and for me was good example of why networks should not attempt to do "real time fact checks" but let opponent respond to any false claims. Whether or not you believe Trump or Kamala were lying, it's not the job of the moderator to make these kinds of calls.
They raised and fixated on topics I don't care about (Jan 6). They declared that Trump "wasn't being sarcastic" with his "by a whisker" response, as if networks had proven themselves to have good sarcasm detection skills (dictator for a day, anyone?)
Trump didn't do himself any favors. He could have pivoted and focused on policy, but instead got dragged down into defending every attack against him. It was not a good night for him, though he had a few good moments. He missed many obvious-in-hindsight opportunities to counterpunch.
No, those aren't my "key issues" - they are the issues that were thrust upon us by the moderators. Sadly, very little policy discussion during the debate, and I didn't learn anything about what Kamala is planning to do differently from current administration.
If I could ask him a few additional questions, I would have asked him:
...
I didn‚Äôt watch the whole thing. But from what I‚Äôve saw, he did ok on some things. But it was frustrating. He needs to learn to stop taking the bait and stay on topic. A good example was when Kamala mentioned the disastrous border bill that he rightfully blocked. But then followed it with a bunch of stuff about his rallies. It should‚Äôve been a quick pivot, like: ‚Äúyes, please come to my rallies. See that everything she said is a lie. I invite you.‚Äù But then immediately‚Äù As far as the border bill, that was blocked for a reason. It did exactly opposite of what it said it was going to do. That‚Äôs the problem with bills these days you have to actually know what the content is because they can be intentionally deceiving.‚Äù
The after birth thing completely sounds unhinged. He should have real statistical data since he talks about it all the time. 12 states allow abortions up until birth. Kamala Harris supports this. You can even say there‚Äôs politicians that support the idea of not getting care after a botched abortion which actually does happen, and shouldn‚Äôt happen because that child is at that point an infant. Children as young as 22 weeks development have been known to survive. And though most abortions are first trimester, second trimester abortions do happen often. You can talk about that, botched abortions, partial birth abortions, late term abortions, but stop talking about the governor of Virginia. Geez.
As far as the Haitian thing I wish he would‚Äôve said it differently, you can focus on 20,000 people overwhelming a 58,000 person town who had no say and their lives been destroyed because of it. Eating ducks and cats is one thing but it‚Äôs also just simple math. He can‚Äôt stick to simple though. He actually needs to learn from JD Vance because his answer to this question was absolutely impressive. As far as is it happening, according to residents (read all their testimonies on Twitter) yes. The eating a cat arrest is misinformation though. That doesn‚Äôt mean all of these residents‚Äô testimonies should be placed ignored though. I also believe it because I stayed in Haiti for a month and honestly, if you‚Äôve never been there, you really don‚Äôt understand. This isn‚Äôt about race. It‚Äôs about a culture that‚Äôs so so different to everything here. And men (not all of course just you don‚Äôt know who came here) that are particularly hard to convince of a different way of living to a somewhat scary extent.
Personally, I did not think he did particularly well. Harris was better prepared. I did not much of the content of her answers, but she was in an impossible position and did the best she could under the circumstances.
It is difficult to judge properly because everything Harris and Biden says sounds empty and politically motivated to me, while what Democrats hear as Trump lying I hear as Trump being a promoter and exaggerating.
This debate was just a condensed version of both of them. It was probably still beneficial to the independent and undecided voters, but for me, I want my hour and a half back.









I do not think it was his best performance. I felt like he went off topic more than he should have. In my opinion he could easily have won if he stuck to the facts. His economy pre-COVID was better. Harris' track record is abysmal/non-existent. Instead he tried to pull a Reagan and answer the question he wished he was asked, but he is not the great communicator Reagan was, and he did not pull it off. He went off on conspiracy theories instead of reinforcing his record. That's fine for his rallies, but it was not what he needed to do here.
If I could ask follow up questions to Trump, and Trump only, this is what I would ask:
-Mr. President, do you believe riots have any place in modern society?
-Mr. President, what do you think the US can do to discourage illegal migration aside from the deportations and the wall?
-Mr. President, what are your ideas for improving the Veterans Administration?
-Mr. President, what are your ideas for tackling the homeless crisis?
I'm sure there's more, those are just the ones on the top of my head.







The actual statement given as part of their plea deal is more tame than the headline.
‚ÄúWe hereby reaffirm that Joseph R. Biden, Jr. won the 2020 presidential election and that we were not the duly elected presidential electors for the State of Wisconsin for the 2020 presidential election. We oppose any attempt to undermine the public‚Äôs faith in the ultimate results of the 2020 presidential election.‚Äù







Or is it at all possible that they lied, got caught lying, and so admitted they lied?
Are you familiar with Ocaam's Razor?
I'm more bothered by this.

So why do you vote for proven liars?
They should all be thrown in prison

I agree, that is what you guys say. But do you have any actual proof of any of this?
Why aren‚Äôt republicans willing to fight for America anymore? My grandfather was a lawyer who put himself through flight school so that he could fight the Japanese after Pearl Harbor. He was also a lifelong republican.
Why won‚Äôt modern republicans fight for what they believe in? These people certified that Trump won Wisconsin but now are claiming that they were suckered by Trump and are not only withdrawing their previous statements but also claiming that they no longer support Trump and won‚Äôt even vote for him in 2024.
When did republicans lose their balls?

What‚Äôs fishy if his lawyers plead guilty as well?

Couldn't Donald help them as they have all forever tainted their names for him?











Do I think AI is being used by Kamala Harris campaign to make her crowds look bigger? No. Would it surprise me if a campaign actually did this? Yeah - getting caught would be pretty embarrassing.
That said there is long history of similar things here and the lines are sure to get blurred further in future.
There have been fake ai generated photos of Trump surrounded by smiling black people shared online to mock him.
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna141949
There have been obviously photoshopped crowds from Trump rallies generated and posted from satire accounts:
https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/altered-image-trump-rally-crowd-stems-satire-account-2024-05-29/
Neither of above were actually from Trump campaign but it did not stop people from gleefully sharing them.
There have been parody political videos using AI to say silly things with what sounds like a politician‚Äôs voice.
It would be crossing a line to have a campaign use AI in public messaging. But it will surely happen eventually.
Most official campaign photos of crowds are carefully cropped to try and give the illusion of massive crowds. Not AI but achieves a similar effect.
We have seen messages carefully spliced from multiple takes to try and make a candidate look/sound good. What is to stop a campaign from generating a political message of their candidate using ai images and voice? You could craft messages targeting every state/city at a fraction of the cost.





Either lying, mis-informed, or purposely misleading. All of which are standard daily occurrences for most politicians. Especially for those that run for President/VP.
Try not to read too much into what gets said on a daily basis. Political climate especially around election time is pure manipulation.
it's very unlikely







At the beginning of the war he gave an interview (10 minute video) where he was pushing for the US to get off the sidelines and ignore Putin‚Äôs nuclear bluffs, and he said this:


I mean I would say its primarily coming from a place of not thinking it would do any good.
Putin is going to do what Putin is going to do regardless of the moral condemnations any western leader levies at him, the only international bodies we have agency over are the ones we have control over as such it makes sense for us to critique the strategy of these bodies rather then Putin.
Honestly its emblamatic to me of a similar "disagreement" liberals and conservatives often have through talking past each other on the subject of sexual assualt. Alot of liberals will tend to concentrate souly on the moral condemnation of rapists and abusers and dismiss any perscriptive statements towards young women as "victim blaming" very much in the same head space as the are on the Ukraine Russia Trump thing.
Rapists (being the human scum of the earth they are) are going to attempt to rape women regardless of our moral condemnations of them. Everyone KNOWS its BAD to do something like that just like Vladmir Putin KNEW it was BAD to invade ukraine but saying that isn't going to stop that from happening.
All that is going to stop that from happening are the steps people/nations who do not wish to abused (or the people/nations who do not wish to se other people/nations abused) take to insure that doesn't happen.



Is praise effective?














What does Kamabla mean?




I‚Äôd even add in for all mail in ballots, must include a copy of picture ID.
If I need to show ID in person to vote, then hell yes you need to submit one with your mail in ballot.


I agree that the post title should've ended the quotation mark after "every right." But the post text does give the exact quote.
What does Trump say he has "every right" to do? Does Trump say "secure" the election? Or does he say "interfere with" the election?

Can you point to another example in modern history?







I don't want to get my political advice from Taylor Swift, Kanye West, or 50 Cent.
I never understood the value of celebrity endorsements.





You wrote a lot of words. I can tell you that I don‚Äôt care about the AI nonsense. I don‚Äôt care now, and never have cared, about anything that happens on X/Twitter.
Most Trump supporters understand jokes and memes and would have seen this for what it was. Not real and funny.





I wish OP had shared above in their initial post.
Or this:
https://www.newsweek.com/swifties-donald-trump-real-what-we-know-1941057
"One of the images in Trump's post‚Äîof a woman in a white "Swifties for Trump" T-shirt‚Äîis not fake. One image showed Jenna Piwowarczyk wear the homemade T-shirt to a Trump rally in Racine, Wisconsin, in June. Piwowarczyk went on to explain her decision to start the movement in a YouTube video.
https://www.newsweek.com/swifties-donald-trump-real-what-we-know-1941057
"I think this movement is super awesome but also super important because it's no secret that young female voters consider themselves Swifties. And we don't want them to have to choose between loving Taylor Swift and supporting their conservative ideologies at the ballot box in November," she said."







Everybody knows that if Trump calls within 48 hours the man goes to heaven, if Trump calls after 48 hours the man goes to hell. Trump doomed this man's soul for eternity
Nobody seems to care because it doesn't matter at this point. If he never called, then yeah that would be bad, but this post aged faster than a mayfly and he has called. Hard to put myself in her position, but I think I'd prefer he waited a bit to call, like he did or maybe even longer, so things have calmed down a bit and not when things are so hectic with 40 asshole journalists in the yard and the phone ringing off the hook and busy making funeral arrangements, etc.
Turning off notifications, so don't waste your time, since this thread is so fresh and I don't want 20 followups with 18 of them being stupid, and I don't know what really needs to be clarified. Only reasonable followup I can think of is "do you think he called because of the reporting that he hasn't called", and I don't know, possibly, probably not. I would think if that was his motivation he would have posted about his call to make sure people knew. Doesn't really matter either way to me because there's no way he wasn't gonna call or visit
And Trump did not play golf, that's been debunked (shocking, I know), although I can't conjure up any reason why it would matter in the slightest whether or not he played golf anyway





Would it not be better for the victims if we had universal single payer health insurance so that Americans would not have beg for money on "GoFundMe" for basic human compassion and health care?
No, the man just got shot, good grief give him time to recover. Helen Comperatore has said in a social media post that Trump called her on Tuesday.
Him golfing has already been debunked
Let's be honest, Biden just called for political props, and yet got rejected by the widow.




To me if you have time to play stick ball you have time to make a phone call regardless. It doesn't convey strength to me. Does it to you?







Is this new? Ken Block has been sharing this for some time.
This bit of warmed over leftovers is due to two things.
Problem with (2) is twofold:
- the reports all include caveat "sufficient to change the outcome of the election" which does not mean there was no fraud.
- even if Trump was personally told to his face by Ken Block "I don't believe there was fraud" that doesn't mean Trump didn't cover his ears and sing "nananana" and refuse to believe what he was told.
Trump administration had hired not one, but two firms hoping to prove significant fraud. They clearly did not believe the first report.

Can we move on and focus on 2024?
For the TS that still consider 2020 suspect, what can/should we do in 2024 to restore confidence? I think one of the biggest things to raise eyebrows was social media in concert banning any questions about election legitimacy. It smelled like being gaslit.
Better to let any accusations get sunlight and debunked in public rather than to be told you aren't allowed to ask questions.
How do you suppose Trump would respond to that?
Roughly a third of Americans continues to live under the illusion that geriatric, confused, sleepy Joe was just geriatric, confused, and sleepy enough to mastermind a perfectly plotted and executed hostile takeover of the Presidency. Who do you think needs to "move on"?
"- the reports all include caveat "sufficient to change the outcome of the election" which does not mean there was no fraud."
No one has ever argued there was absolutely no fraud. But systems in place to discover fraud are considered comprehensive by election officials and experts of both parties. Fewer than 500 documented cases of election fraud in the 2020 Presidential election have been discovered, with more than half being instances where Trump benefited. Because it is logically impossible to prove a negative, should people consider every possibility a certainty, even when there is no evidence that significant frsud swayed the election?
If Trump genuinely believes that there was enough fraud to keep him from being elected despite there being no evidence for it, and actual evidence disproving the specific allegations that were made, doesn't that put his judgement into question? He had to discount everything he was told about losing by those trusted advisors, experts and lawyers he had relied on for large decisions in the past and instead chose to believe people like Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani. Doesn't that really call his judgement into question? If he is willing to seek out counsel to tell him things he wants to hear when the people closest to him have evidence to the contrary how safe can Americans feel about his decision-making ability? If your car's gas gauge showed an eighth of a tank remaining but you really wanted to drive 200 miles would it be reasonable to simply decide to believe you had a full tank?




















So you're all for the elderly and the physically disabled losing their voting rights?
Let's consider the following:
You're in a car crash on the way home, the fault of a drunk driver. You're significantly injured and are bound to a bed for the next 12 months on life support, do you think you should still get the right to vote? Or because you can't move now as a result of someone else's Idiocracy, should that instantly remove your rights at a citizen?


















Impeachment unless it has support in the Senate for a conviction is pointless posturing.





Interesting that you mention "Biden crime family" as being a fact.. I'll refrain from disputing your claims against Biden for just a moment and concentrate on the fact that you seem to be not a fan of crime, corruption, stealing, or favoritism.
Looking at the 100s of charges and allegations and rulings against Trump, I'll include a just a few notable ones I can recall of the top of my head:
Here is a longer list: https://www.justsecurity.org/75032/litigation-tracker-pending-criminal-and-civil-cases-against-donald-trump/
Given the above, how do you rationalize supporting Trump while being willing to accept, without evidence, that Biden runs a 'crime family'? How does the math add up behind that rationale? Given your logic, would the term 'Trump Crime Family' be an appropriate label to use when discussing Trump going forward?











Have you ever heard of the expression "When all you have is a hammer, everything will look like a nail"?


‚ÄúThe Big Guy‚Äù here in the American south often refers to God. A 10% tithe to God is exactly what the Bible commands from us. Isn‚Äôt it also possible Hunter was giving to his church or charity?

why should Biden be impeached for following US laws regarding Asylum seekers?
Do you genuinely feel that having the most deportations and strongest anti-illegal-immigration stances should get a president impeached?



Do you have any evidence of this?







Not really. The debate like most is ran by the extreme and nobody is going to compromise because Republicans have created a wedge issue.
This is a prime example of why I want the government to have less power.
Side note: I‚Äôve recently learned that ‚Äúthe government having less power‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù; or at least not everybody sees the phrase the same way. Maybe limited government would be a better phraseü§î


And for all the people who down voted the above comment, I'm really concerned as to why people are down voting me. I am in agreement that this may be a medical necessity. My opinion is not radical. Honestly I believe I've met you halfway even if I am pro-life. I'll be the first person to say this and I'm quitting Joe Biden by saying it. "Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare" I further submit that the "rare" should be emphasized.




I‚Äôm not sure of what the implications are here?
Maybe I didn‚Äôt read it enough, but it sounds like one of those cases the left worries about where abortion is justified or warranted but the courts are not allowing it.
The activist judge is allowing the abortion, but the attorney general is not wanting it but going to sue the hospital that performs it?


The U.S. supreme court would definitely decline this argument due to the similarity to Roe v. Wade. As far as everyone can sue , it sounds ridiculous. But I submit that they were outside of state lines, how can Texas law apply?
Texas likely has two reasons for going after people out of state:
Do you think this is the strategy Texas is utilizing?
The system is working as intended.
This is a case where it is possible for a woman in Texas to get an abortion under very specific circumstances, but the legal procedure has been created as such so that it is virtually impossible for her to get one.
This is very common in our judicial system. Your one vote elects people who make rules you did not intend, or worse yet, agencies who can make rules at their whim that you did not intend.
The people with real political power are those we elect who are subordinate to their monied benefactors and the agencies they create to do their job for them.
The government is not your friend.
If we truly wish for the medical exemptions to be accurate, we must challenge them to make sure it is within the margins we allow. Based upon the article and diagnosis, the woman‚Äôs condition should fall within the parameters. I think this is one case that doesn‚Äôt need to be tried as other cases in the past or future may be.
If the best Paxton can do is threaten to sue hospitals, than it seems like he is going to extremes and lacks the ability to properly challenge the TRO otherwise. If this is truly a dangerous condition this woman has, doctors should go ahead with the procedure. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission in some cases.
As somebody said, ‚Äúif you get into the legal system you may not get justice, but you will get the law‚Äù.
My understanding is that Paxton believes her condition does not fall into the medical exception of the Texas law. If that is correct, his literal job is to enforce the law as written.
If he allows this to go unchallenged, it opens the gates to women going around the law and getting a judge to ok their abortion.














I'm fine with the terms. I like the additional u/TargetPrior suggestion of "The candidates must be isolated during the debate. No helpers, computers, or otherwise advising." Biden can't be using an earpiece with someone feeding him answers.
Honestly, I would like to see both these guys go without drugs for 24 hours and have zero help during the debate.
I have a feeling that neither of these guys are nothing without handlers haha
I would respond as such:
I do not think either of these old fucks could memorize all the possibilities here, and we would see their cognitive abilities without drugs.
I think the candidates should not be allowed earpieces or teleprompters, and the questions should not be given in advance.








Anyone old enough to remember this? "following the machine recount, the Gore campaign requested a manual recount in (only) four counties."
In the history of contested elections, the loser has always only challenged (only) places where they lost. What kind of moron would someone have to be to challenge a winner take all state where they won? Let the opponent spend the dough if they see fit.
Someone who above all else cares about election integrity, as Trump has said millions of times?
What if the real fraud was actually in the states he won?
If it's mass voting fraud, then why not investigate every state? At the end of the day, the actual state doesn't even matter. As long as he can prove it in one state, then that's all that's needed to prove it likely happened elsewhere. Public opinion would instantly shift.
Remember when SCOTUS stopped the recount and handed the election to Bush by 537 votes? And Gore STILL conceded because that's how the peaceful transfer of power works?

why do any of you think the intentions of a politician would ever be pure? have you not been paying attention the last few decades

"For years, legal scholars have worried the law was poorly written and in need of clarification, and former President Donald Trump and his allies targeted the law's ambiguities in their attempts to overturn the 2020 election."
What Trump attempted to do relied on ambiguities in existing election law. It was unlikely to succeed, as courts would almost certainly have jumped in. But with passing of Electoral Count Act, the ceremonial role of VP is clarified and limited, meaning this potential loophole is now closed.

That‚Äôs an interesting point. I‚Äôm a bit younger (41), but did JFK supporters end up storming the capitol in 1960 due to JFK‚Äôs lies about supposed election fraud?
Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòalternate electors‚Äô were not official, state sanctioned electors as was the case with Kennedy‚Äôs, were they?









Well, if the election was truly stolen from Trump, then I'll admit he is the real president at present and can't serve a 3rd term. That should settle this whole debate, yeah?
Do you think OP might have made an honest mistake in his title, and meant ‚Äúwin?‚Äù If so, do you have an answer for OPs question?
Yes. Free and fair elections are the only thing separating civil society from civil war.
The VP has a constitutional duty to prevent a coup, same as the President does.
Neither Mike Pence nor Kamala Harris had/have this power
