It‚Äôs amazing that so many people who think of themselves as being intelligent or savvy don‚Äôt realize the obvious until the policies they support impact them personally.
People who are truly intelligent or savvy learn from the experiences of others.  Ignorance is excusable for topics you haven‚Äôt studied, but Ana has given a great deal of thought to this very situation‚Ä¶ yet it took her being personally impacted to wake her up.
There‚Äôs an old saying that ‚ÄúA liberal is a conservative who hasn‚Äôt been mugged yet.‚Äù  In Ana‚Äôs case, the ‚Äúmugging‚Äù took the form of a sexual assault.  I wish I could say that this sort of naivety was confined to the political left, but there‚Äôs an awful lot of bootlicking on our side of the aisle when it comes to police brutality and misconduct. The corresponding saying is, ‚ÄúBack the blue ‚Äòtil it happens to you.‚Äù
Edit:
Oh, the delicious irony.  Ana K became both rich and famous doing that very thing to conservatives.
Everybody is anti gun until they need one
A story as old as time.
A Conservative is just a Leftist that has been shamed by their friends after being molested by a homeless man with an erection.
Thus it has always been, thus it shall ever be.
A conservative has a completely different view of how the government should work.
I bet she brought several guns after this incident and decide to get a CCW permit.
I wonder what Cenk has to say about all of this?
He was the homeless guy
That's great and all, but does nobody else base their political standing on what they think is right vs just going along with a particular side because they think they're good people?
They all love the communist Utopia until they're directly affected by it, that's when they realize liberal policies do not work in the real world.
And they say the right is a cult üôÑ
It‚Äôs not just the ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù.
If they didn‚Äôt throw in a ‚Äúfact check‚Äù, then they would add a BS remark castigating trump in some way, and then switching over to Kamala.
Either the moderators ‚Äúfact checked‚Äù trump or they injected a statement of their own opinion about trump.
Unprofessional and obviously biased.
I hope most people can see through the BS
Oh, you know they won't. On purpose, in fact. RM on CNN had all kinds of negative things to say about Trump and glorified Harris once again. The left is seething with joy right now.
Ya it was a joke
She doesn't use factual statements. She lives in a realm of subjective 'feelings'
I find it so crazy that there‚Äôs not a second debate on fox to balance it out
Most definitely needs to be a second debate on FOX these moderators were out of line, both of them are well known as Republican haters they are both proved at time and time again.
I would say NewsMax after this ABC circle jerk.
They had to help her. It goes with their theme on any dirty trick anybody but trump
I saw that right away, ended up watching something else 5 mins in. I didn‚Äôt want to give ABC any more ratings for their unprofessional biased trash
Republicans gotta stop agreeing to debates on biased liberal networks.
This is the way.
...a ray of hope
God bless these young men.  Gives me hope for our country.
We need more people to stand up and say ‚Äúenough‚Äù.

Because they hate Jews more. They‚Äôre Nazis. Hate doesn‚Äôt make sense.
Would be cool if this started a trend
Nice.
If I was there I'd have a personal body cam on. I know the pro-palistine people don't have to worry about it as they take over the university but those standing up to them or protecting something need to be careful or they will wind up in jail for several years like J6 people are. Trump needs to pardon all of them, if it was handled differently or the sentences given were at least somewhat reasonable I would say it should be a case by case thing but not anymore
That's my Tar Heels!
After this they shoudlve started smashing those incel warriors
Where is she getting those numbers?
Is there a source for these number?

source?


...and remember when looking at those numbers, that the FBI changed its reporting method in 2021, and a lot of jurisdictions stopped reporting.
Major cities like San Francisco and NYC are still not reporting crimes.
They drop the charges at around 80% of the time in these "places". Over 70% of crimes go unreported due to "they don't do shit anyway". Numbers are just numbers. But hey unemployment is down! That's because everyone that fell off unemployment has 2 gig jobs that barely pay for food.
These sort of numbers should have been reported before now. And I don't mean by the MSM. What is the source of these numbers?
How dare you cuh
How dare you!
HOW DARE YOU!!!
Greta's classmates would be a diverse mix of ethnicities despite Sweden being 83% white. Her BBFL would be an effeminate BIPOC gay boy.
The showdown with the final boss would be against a cishet old white male CEO.
Joe Biden would be portrayed as highly intelligent and at full mental capacity.
Donald Trump would have his orange skin dial turned up to 11 and his hand size dial turned all the way down to 0.1. He'd also be a drooling, idiot. He'd be super skinny though because these days being obese is beautiful.
Sadly this is the truth.
You finna gestroy da earf!
...and make her lame!
And gay
If they ever make a movie about Kyle Rittenhouse, they'll use the same person to portray him, too.
[Edit: just realized I am wrong - Kyle is supposed to be the villain, so he'll be played by Ashton Kutcher.]
How dare Yo!
Shitty minutes has a lot of apologize for. That shitty minutes interview with that scumbag Stahl was such a disgrace how she lied and lied. Then they tried to edit it to make trump look bad, and he fucking released the full unedited interview like a fucking legend.
He should never give them another interview honestly. They don‚Äôt deserve the ratings. Fuck them.
‚ÄúSir, sir, but, sir‚Äù.Being on the left means you seldom have to apologize. Only intentions count.
If he refuses partisan left outlets, maybe they will clean up their act. He doesn‚Äôt need them. He does plenty of press conferences and rallies and other public appearances and all that 60 Minutes brings to the table is slanted questioning and partisan editing
Dave Ramsey's interview with Trump posted Wednesday (yesterday when this was posted) has almost 2 million views - 5x more than the next closest video. Trump is a ratings gold mine. Of course 60 Min. wants him on. But he doesn't need them. His message gets out over the web to millions and millions of people. He does a favor to anyone he grants an interview. And he doesn't owe 60 Min. any favors.
Just a hint. Get ready MSM you gave him a grudge.
Why would he ever do one anyway? In the last election, Diane Sawyer gave a super softball 60 Minutes interview to Biden and then came at Trump like a she bear who had just lost her cub. If I had been Trump, I would‚Äôve permanently crossed 60 minutes off my interview list.
Just as well he either gets his apology or he doesn't sit down for a hit peice interview that will be peiced together to put him in the worst light anyways.
Exactly. I still wouldn‚Äôt do it. He should do a town hall on Newsmax or Breitbart.
It‚Äôs not reporting. It‚Äôs not journalism. It‚Äôs a propaganda wing for left wing politics. They don‚Äôt even pretend anymore. They just never get called out on it.
I would agree. As long as the Guest Host was Tucker Carlson doing the interview. Think 60 minutes will bite?
What's funny is when Donald Trump was a Democrat and donating big money, no one cared he was banging all the hot supermodels that wouldn't touch a normal human being.
...which points out the stupidity of believing that Trump would follow some random woman around a department store for the purpose of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room.
Democrats just attacked Trump's sex life because there was finally a Republucan in office who did some of the same things that nearly every Demonrat president in the last 60+ years has done. Now that they have a candidate that is a woman, they can no longer be accused of the president being a whore monger. Instead they are running the whore that everyone else has already banged.
I wish I had a sex life.
Don't worry, if Kamala is elected, she'll fuck us all
Here‚Äôs hoping you get lucky soon!
Let's see those tax records as well. The last 4 years should be interesting
Republicans are supported by Christians; they‚Äôre supposed to be the ‚Äúmoral‚Äù party. Dems are the party of polygamy, homosexuality, pansexuality, etc. no one expects them to have any sexual morals.
While I agree with the point, Id really rather not think about Harris and sex in the same month, much less the same discussion.
The left opens the door but never can take it when it gets clapped back because as Rush used to say, "Sexual deviance is a resume enhancer " for Democrats (see Bill Clinton, Barney Frank, Anthony Weiner, Al Franken, etc)
Past Republicans are mostly RINO's. I am Disgusted with the average/old Republican. They don't know how to fight. They don't give a shit about the Constitution. And they just seem slimy. Pretty much all of DC needs a serious, serious deep cleaning.
The decision itself is illuminating of the justices' mindsets and the facts involved in the "insurrection" finding, as a matter of fact.
IF you watch CNN to obtain your factual conclusions about J6, then the decision probably makes sense to you, and almost seem self evident.
On the other hand, IF you base your factual conclusions on facts established during the J6 hearings (which was the ostensible purpose of those hearings), you know there is no factual basis connecting Trump to the riots.
This is what alarms me about this decision. Fake news doesn't just influence your neighbors, it influences those who are supposed to be beyond influence.
You watched the J6 hearings!?
It‚Äôs a part of the puppet show. Grab your popcorn.
You mean democrats act like spoiled kids that never got told no? Sounds about right.
Time to remove some supreme court justices at a state level who clearly don't know the law.
It is very third world like and cowardly to persecute one of the candidates
Yeah we all know how unpopular DJT is you can see it when he goes into an arena lol
In Colorado: decisions made by Voters is best left to Un-Elected Scumbags
They don‚Äôt even try to hide it. In their minds laws are for the little people.
As she wags her finger at Trump & says ‚Äú no one is above the law‚Äù.
these people make me sick
Technically the laws are setup so that congressional people can‚Äôt be punished.


Coincidence, same as always, I wish the old bat was running my 401k. /S
Oh how shocking‚Ä¶.not the pelos‚Äôs. Not these upstanding citizens
Yep, everyone knows. The only people who can do anything about it are the same people doing it.
Law only applies to Republicans
They call that insider trading....
And charge them with election interference.
Why bother with clearances. They should be fired/banned from government intelligence just for getting it royally wrong/incompetence.
The 51 who signed the letter were all out of government at the time they signed it, I believe.
They maintain and use their security clearances after they leave government service for employment/financial reasons - and to influence elections.
Heck put them all in jail for lying under oath while we are at it. Maybe if there was real punishment it would help more people be honest.
They weren't under oath - it was just a letter from 51 people trading on their former status as intelligence officials to influence the election.
It won't work again, but it only had to work once.
This should happen. In a just country it would, but not now.
It should - but that would require the Intelligence agencies, DOJ, and Executive not be corrupt.
...and that's not the country we live in.
It would be a good start.
Excellent idea‚Ä¶..but it won‚Äôt happen especially with the eunuchs in the GOP. They know we will forget all about out it when the next manufactured crisis comes around.



Incidentally, for anyone proposing a truce.
There was a truce in effect on October 7, agreed to only a couple of weeks prior.
Someone asked me tonight: "What kind of sick and twisted person would do this? Even if they thought these people deserved to die, as horrible as that would be, why do they see a need to torture them?"
That one is easy to answer. All you have to do is think like a sociopath.
There are three reasons to torture someone, assuming you aren't trying to get information from them.
‚ÄúWhat kind of sick and twisted person would do this?‚Äù
A terrorist! They‚Äôre fucking terrorists!
This is the correct answer. And for clarification, it should be noted that the three reasons are not mutually exclusive. It‚Äôs entirely possible all three were in play to varying degrees.
Hamas needs purged
Not just Hamas. On October 7, Gazan "civilians" followed in behind the terrorists and once the defenders were dead, committed more atrocities on the surviving civilians.
From a military standpoint, Hamas "lost" the fight on October 7, as they have lost every other fight with Israel. They came in with 2000 or so fighters, captured no territory, and left 1500 of their own dead in Israel. They killed 1400 people, mostly civilians, and took another 200 hostages. That was with total surprise on an unprepared enemy, that was a soft target.
Since then thousands more have been killed in Gaza. ...and Hamas is fine with that. They understand the nature of warfare:
Wars don't end when one side wins all the battles, takes all of the objectives, or kills all the enemy soldiers.
As long as the civilian population that made those soldiers believes in the cause the war was fought for, they will make more soldiers to replace the ones that were killed.
Wars end when the civilian population believes that idea of one more day of war is so horrible, that they will do anything, give up anything, to make it stop. Modern warfare, with "smart" weapons and the "rules of war" is almost designed to prevent that from happening.
Especially for Muslims, killing all their soldiers isn't enough to make the civilian population want the war stopped. They believe that anyone who dies fighting non-Muslims goes to paradise.
Hamas turned Gaza into a terrorist factory, that turns out terrorists as fast as the women there can pop out kids. If Israel succeeds in killing 99.9% of the Hamas fighters and leaves the remainder of the Gazan population in place, next year there will be 50,000 more fighters ready to take up arms. ...and 50,000 more the year after that.
That's the problem that Israel needs to solve.
The issue is ‚ÄúHamas‚Äù is just another symptom of a growing problem in the Middle East, one in which we as a nation are to timid to address directly.
We can eliminate hamas but the problem will persist under a new name
There's a special place in hell reserved for animals like this.
It is up to God to judge them. It is only incumbent on us to arrange the meeting.
But since it happened to Jews, the world shrugs its shoulders and thinks maybe they deserved it. We can hope for little understanding from the majority of Muslims because they are raised from birth to hate us and want our genocide. Those that don‚Äôt feel this way are afraid to speak out because they will be attacked to. But we do pray that the rest of world opens their eyes and sees what decades of Islamic extremism and indoctrination have done to the majority of Muslims‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Those that don‚Äôt kill us cheer on those that do.
It is the state that sets its assessed property valuations for tax purposes. That has absolutely nothing to do with the market value. Banks issue loans based upon an independent analysis of valuation - which has little to do with the buyer's stated valuation. Trump could have claimed his properties were worth infinite money, and the bank would still have done the same independent analysis of the properties and the applicant's capacity to pay, and would have issued the exact same set of loans, with the same terms - because they are the ones liable for assessing the "actual" market value and capacity to pay - the loans were an at-risk investment. Trying to connect the decisions of a bank to the taxes you pay on a property is absolute bare-faced bullshit farce, and everyone who owns a home or has had anything to do with real-estate knows that is true. My home would sell at a market value significantly higher than the current assessed value for real property taxes. This entire thing is so absolutely bullshit it's difficult to believe it has gone this far.
2 men did the exact same thing. But "orange man bad" while "John Stewart good". People like myself, who believe the law should apply equally to everyone, are somehow " rightwing Nazi bigots" for pointing out that either Stewart needs to be prosecuted, or Trump shouldn't have been.
Yep. Unfortunately 95% of the chumps hearing about this on CNN & MSNBC don‚Äôt know how it all works and actually think Trump scammed the system.
Oh how the turn tables..
Such a douchebag.
If they don‚Äôt file a suit against Stewart for the exact same thing they are going after Trump for, it proves that this is all a political weapon and nothing more.
We already know it is but maybe this will wake up moderates
Stewart is a New York left wing fanatic hiding behind his so called satirical humor. His ratings will be no where near what they were 20 years ago. Just like his former partner in propaganda Steven Colbert who has lost 50% of his audience thanks to his unapologetic constant pro Democrat, anti Republican and left wing political comments.
Now we know Stewart is also a hypocrite and under his so called ethical standards,  a fraud. When will the racist thugs running the New York's Attorney General or Manhattan District Attorney investigate Stewart for fraud? Stewart is a real scumbag!
An honest progressive would have corrected the tax valuation to pay THEIR FAIR SHARE.
Worth noting the low tax valuation on Mar a Lago was worked out as a trade-off between Trump and the taxing entity so Trump would keep the property intact rather than break up the 20 acres and sell them off for a ton of money. Lowered valuation for a low tax vs forgo a huge profit: legal & understandable for all but NY judges/prosecutors.
JS should fire the writers that set him up for this fall ü§£üòÇü§£

Because if he did, he‚Äôd have to admit it was his actions that killed her.
To be fair, he can‚Äôt stand very long
But but but white supremacy and some other nonsense!!
Biden is the threat to our Democracy, NOT TRUMP!
He‚Äôs subhuman.
The whole liberal party doesn't want to say anything about this girl. Because they know their policies killed her. They know that sanctuary cities breed crime that would've otherwise not been there. They don't want to deport any illegal aliens. Every time you bring it up they try to pull some humanitarian BS trope. Liberals killed this girl. Total truth.
Where was the White Guilt phenomenon in Laken‚Äôs death? Where were the fake woke self supremacists, exploiting Laken‚Äôs death for the own self supremacy cause?
It‚Äôs not about Laken Riley, it was and is about a selfish agenda. George Floyd is made out to be a martyr.
What a tool!
They probably haven‚Äôt given him the script on it yet.
So according to Joe, this means she ain‚Äôt black?
üòÜ Well played.
That‚Äôs cool and all, but she nasty
Biden don't care, she ain't black...
Good‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs a successful artist and pays a ton of taxes and can see through the bullshit. This administration has done nothing but fund wars. It‚Äôs a fucking joke.
Lol she still believes Trump to be a 'threat'. These people are so brainwashed.
A threat to what?
Border security? The economy? Peace in the Middle East?
What a relief it is to know that. I make all of my decisions by asking myself what would Cardi B do?
Children have a constitutional right to practice the religion of their choice. If they are smart enough to make life altering physical changes then they are smart enough to make life altering spiritual changes.

The People who advocate for the current gender nonsense would un-ironically absolutely lose their fucking minds... And rightfully so. 
The liberals will have a hissy fit
I think we should baptize kids at school
As a public school teacher I have always wanted to hand out 12 Step Recovery Bibles to adolescents parents. Standard issue in the inner city üåÜ.
Wouldn‚Äôt it have to be a priest? Like a teacher can go through the motions, but would it count?


I smell the bacon roasting from here for discrimination.
Sounds like a clear case of ideological discrimination.. maybe we should get a law on the books that covers this sort of thing /s
Fulton is where they cheated in 2020 with the water pipe burst scheme.
Part of the cheating plan
Just enough Republicans to cover their asses but not enough to stop the massive fraud they are attempting.
At a mere 1.9% of the number of Democrats the number of Republicans arguably isn't even enough for them to cover a single ass cheek.
This is the only way these fuckers can win so you know the fix is already been planned.
Setting up the steal. Followed by the denial and eventually a refusal to investigate anything
Fulton county is such a cheating corrupt shit hole.
So much for Diversity and Equality.
The fact they gave Ellen a special is insane. She‚Äôs a horrible person, never apologized, says she got kicked out of Hollywood, and then gets paid millions for this special. Fuck off, Ellen.
I canceled my subscription today. Long overdue.
When I canceled, it asked why I was canceling. I selected ‚Äòother‚Äô then I had to type the reason. ‚ÄòHarris Endorsement‚Äô I hope this sends a clear message to the AI bots.
Go woke, go broke
I almost kicked them to the curb when they appointed Susan Rice to the Board of Directors. I did kick them to the curb when they made the Official Obama Contract Announcement years ago. All we have had since is is HS Internet and a ROKU TV. No Broadcast or Cable etc. in our home since. No subscriptions of any kind. ROKU offers thousands of channels free. Mostly we just watch movies.
This isn't even news. Every original show on there is as liberal as it gets. (Except stranger things)
You pretty much have to watch Korean shows or Japanese shows to avoid much of the leftist shit that they push. It sometimes seeps in but not nearly like the American based programming.
Cancelled them all, Netfucks was the last
I don‚Äôt think Netflix will go broke anytime soon. Maybe this will be a reminder to Mr Hastings that he represents the company 24/7 and perhaps abstaining from promoting one side would serve him better.
He won't care. They think they're on the "right side of history" and taking some profound moral stand against fascism.
Agreed but if you look at the history of Netflix net worth, it has decreased significantly, 11% since June. In June it was 9.5B, currently 8.5B.
I don't care that they say it. I care that their constituents defend it. When did America become so immoral?
I mean it‚Äôs a circle. I care that they say it, because their constituents will listen to them and do it. I care that their constituents are doing it because the politicians are telling them to do it.
If politicians are just bitching and being ignored, then it‚Äôs relatively harmless. If constituents are just going rogue and harassing people unprompted, then that‚Äôs just an isolated incident. But that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening.
I care they aren't held accountable for their words in the court of public opinion at minimum.
The left views their violence as their right to free speech and the free speech of anyone they disagree with as violence.
Their failure to grasp even the simplest logic, and their absolute rejection of objective reality explain why no one with actual intelligence ever accused leftists of being intelligent.
But only Trump gets blamed for inciting a protest.
Political Lawfare. Hopefully enough people have grown weary of the lies and mistruths.
They cheer the riots on. You should add Shumer's threats to the Supreme court Justices.
They forgot Chucky Schumer threatening the Supreme Court.
It‚Äôs(d)iffernt
Well, no shit.. There is a fucking window between the passenger compartment and the driver. It would be almost physically impossible for Trump to fit his ass anywhere near the steering wheel to have grabbed it.
It cracked me up when I pictured Trump actually trying to do that. It's hard to believe anyone would think it really happened.
No rational person ever believed that it did.
There‚Äôs a rather important word there disqualifying most of Reddit
Redditors will believe it until the day they die.
News to no one
Ah, but MSM covered the highly embellished 3rd person hearsay testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson as"stunning" and put her on par with John Dean. Before her depositions for the House committee and testimony for the cameras , she first leaked the story to ABC and despite the fact that AT THE TIME the driver offered to testify this never happened, media and the committee ran with it. She has since written a book but does not appear to have made it onto MSNBC or CNN as a paid contributor.
Absolutely shocking....
But seriously, this story sounded as if it were made up. Who in their right mind would believe this?
More democrats trying to pull an al gore. It's manbearpig!
Why is this surfacing again? It was bs back in the day and continues to stink in the present time.
I‚Äôm starting to think we are doomed.
2020 worked and now we are just running out the clock.
It's been over for a lot longer than I think anybody realizes.
I don‚Äôt see a red wave, the damn baby killers are motivated‚Ä¶
Waiting for people to start chuckling like schumer "The great red wave was a red mirage"
Elon is right. We cannot survive another 4 yrs of this failing economy.
üá∫üá∏. MUST VOTE TRUMP!
Pretty much....not sure how much more lefty subversion and insanity our country can take. Trump needs to win.
How to lose half of the people that liked you with one ignorant short rant.
Silence is golden
They didn't even apologize either. The easiest thing in the world and old Jackie couldn't bring himself to do that, he just put out a bullshit statement saying they are cancelling the rest of the tour.
I hate the fact that the celebrities I grew up loving had to get involved in political warfare. If you're in the spotlight, you should just leave your politics at home. I'm here for your art, not your political activism, as if you're being suppressed somehow. You literally have guys like DeNiro talking about the end of the world if Trump wins. What an absolute joke.
‚ÄúRepublicans buy shoes, too.‚Äù Michael Jordan
Couldn't agree more. I try to shut it out and ignore them so I can enjoy their art. This isn't the first time Jack black has said something political that I disagree with but now it's difficult for me to ignore. He is now with Madonna, Johnny Depp and others that have severely crossed the line with their political rhetoric. Sad.
Edit: I was slightly miss informed here and should have read more first. Kyle, not Jack said it but the sentiment of my response remains. And Jack has said things in the past that I disagree with though I've been able to look past it and can continue to do so. Kyle remains undecided if I will accept his apology. Not that I'm important enough for that to matter to him.
They were on tour in Australia where an Australian senator threatened to have them deported.
It's not regret it's their own butt they are now worried about.
F these guys
Doesn‚Äôt change anything! That is the true sentiment on the left‚Ä¶ they will just be more careful for awhile‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs a shame. They‚Äôre a great musical group, with shitty, uninformed political opinions.
Having their money taken away is the only way these people are going to learn.
And the GOP will do nothing but run their pie holes.
This is what the Democrat party has devolved into.
Count on Merchan to place restrictions on Trump that make campaigning close to imposible. Anticipate the Biden campaign using 'felon' in every ad, further attempts to take Trump off the ballot and more. Last but not least, expect the DOJ and intelligence agencies to expand their surveillance and intimidation efforts to a much broader swath of the public, i.e. the large number of people who will expresss outrage at this garbage. The White House has been looking for an excuse to use Presidential Emergency Powers; maybe they've manufactured one?
Dems make up "collusion" to claim election interference and then engage in blatant election interference and call it justice.
Fucking clowns.
Our government doesn't care about Americans
I wonder if some district attorney in a red state waits until Biden gets the nomination and surprise, surprise. Biden is charged with a crime.
Agreed

He‚Äôs not wrong.
Too late I‚Äôm afraid. I never thought at the end of my old life (I‚Äôll be 69 next month) I‚Äôd ever see the US in such a sorry state of affairs. Makes me glad I‚Äôll likely not live long enough to see the actual demise.
It's not too late. Find a worthy apprentice and teach him the ways of Conservativism.

I think that ship has sailed.....
Right. That‚Äôs the point. The globalists and their stooges in office in nearly every country want to erase all borders and create a global superstate, one world government (which they rule, of course) just like in Revelations in the Bible.
Ah, the Globalist agenda‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs too late.
This has been the democrats plan since the Clinton administration. Really gained momentum with the Obama administration. Their goal have the democrats as a ruling class and the entire population will do as they say, or lose access to things like healthcare, food and fuel.
If we don‚Äôt kick the illegals out, they will attack from within. If we do kick the illegals out, they will attack from within. There are now 30 million+++ illegals in the country; 10% of the population.
Every one of them is a criminal. Most of them are military aged males. How do we defend our borders from military attack when we are getting attacked by those within our country?
How many people pulled off 9/11? Less than 3 dozen? Imagine 100 9/11 attacks happening in one day, or 1000?
Leftistism has gone from weird to evil and coming for your children real fast.
It‚Äôs odd more Americans haven‚Äôt come together to reject this. The party pushing this seems keep being rewarded with wins. Making me think all hope is lost to condemn this stuff
Democrats just love democracy...as long as everything goes their way.
Just not too long ago they were singing Ohio‚Äôs praises for enshrining abortion protections in their state‚Äôs constitution. Now they want it burned to cinders because creeps taking advantage of the LGBTQ identity (and using as a shield from criticism) can‚Äôt legally pressure kids into getting sex-change operations. Fickle creatures, those leftists.
Hopefully Ohioans are taking notes and spread awareness about how utterly deranged and removed from reality the Dems have become, and that Ohio voters translate that repudiation of DNC-backed lunacy into votes for Republicans this November.
Honestly I don‚Äôt understand how anyone in their right mind can look at somebody like the person in the thumbnail and not automatically think they‚Äôre mentally unstable. That is the entire demonrat party.
There was a time when the mentally unstable people would be forced to face reality, and would then either straighten out or end up committed.
Now, they're celebrated until they completely lose it and suicide and/or murder a bunch of people.
Leftistism has gone from weird to evil and coming for your children real fast.
The left is obsessed with child genital mutilation.
It‚Äôs insane that this is even a conversation
Make Asylums Great Again
I kinda figured the 8 times (or so) that he pulled the trigger on Trump confirmed that.
mOtiVe UnCLeAr
Exactly. I still don't understand what the "he was a republican!!" crowd was trying to prove.
Yeh he only signed up to be republican to vote in the primary against trump
People are willfully ignorant about this.
My husband (a staunch conservative) did this.
He explained that he wasn't really concerned about Republican elections. That he was way more concerned about the crazies in the Democrat party.
So, he registered as a Democrat so he could vote in their primaries & runoff elections.
It was a way to try & ensure the most conservative of the Democrats would get elected instead of their normally batshit crazy liberals. üòä
Per the article: NEW: Thomas Matthew Crooks made nine posts on Gab supporting President Biden, COVID lockdowns, and Biden‚Äôs border policies, according to Gab Founder Andrew Torba (@BasedTorba).
‚ÄúIm sorry explain to me how trump was ever concerned with what the left wanted, or anybody in the GOP for that matter?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe reason all the deaths are down is because you are in stuck in your house.‚Äù
‚ÄúActually the executive order allows an easier path to US citizenship therefore no longer making them illegals and allowing children to join their already legalized immigrant parents in the US.‚Äù
‚Äúfirst of all Biden executive orders don‚Äôt incentivize human trafficking as human traffickers aren‚Äôt interested in citizenships, likewise the majority of illegal immigrants are not criminals and in fact some studies(such as the one linked below) show lower rates of crime committed by these individuals, it is also unclear if the extensive path to citizenship is in fact effective at routing out potential bad actors hence why there is a review of that system.‚Äù
‚ÄúThats funny because the first order mandates a reuniting of any families separated at the border, the 2nd and 3rd orders a review of trumps immigration policies and other previous policies. However his order doesn‚Äôt actually open borders or reduce the authority of border patrol, or anything that would substantially reduce BP effectiveness.‚Äù
You are truly regarded if you think the photoshopped Biden hat was meant to be taken literally. It‚Äôs poorly photoshopped. It‚Äôs photoshopped on his most widely circulated photo. His posts show that his politics were consistent of that of a democrat. He fancied himself an intellectual ‚Äúakchually‚Äù type. He was a failed assassin, who won‚Äôt ever be remembered fondly ever again, by anyone.
Of course‚Ä¶ anyone thinking or believing the media nonsense is an idiot. No supporter would try and kill the very person they support üòÜ
So that's most of the Democrats? They are actually floating this.
Biden supporters will never hear that.
Hopefully they have the good sense to VOTE TRUMP üá∫üá∏
No such thing as a Christian Democrat.
I read somewhere that you can be a conservative without being a Christian but you can‚Äôt be a practicing, living by the Bible Christian and be a democrat. Not with their policies and beliefs these days
And I thought Biden is the most divisive president we‚Äôve ever had. If she gets in, I think she‚Äôll divide the country even more blatantly and without thought or caring than Biden has.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the president for all Americans‚Äù
It‚Äôs statements like that, that suggest to me that she doesn‚Äôt consider right leaning Americans as American, or even part of American society‚Ä¶.
It‚Äôs obvious she was saving up the line trying to have her viral ‚Äúmoment‚Äù. Someone on her earpiece probably said ‚Äúuse the attack line now!‚Äù
But she didn‚Äôt realize it was against the Christian demographic.
Kamala is a phony.
Two things I don't understand. Why is killing the baby you carelessly started called "reproductive freedom". Why don't they push contraception instead of abortion? I know what abortion is, because i've had one. The worst thing I ever did in my life.
I don‚Äôt disagree with what they‚Äôre saying here but this was the wrong forum and I think that hurts their message. If you‚Äôre heckling a speaker, you‚Äôre going to be removed no matter your beliefs or politics. That doesn‚Äôt make you virtuous for interrupting and I really wish they weren‚Äôt framing it that way.
The guilty verdict changes nothing. A prison sentence will change nothing. November 5th will change everything.
So what are the lefties so happy about?
Do they even understand what‚Äôs going on? Sometimes I don‚Äôt think so.
Excellent point. We conservatives handle the news like the sane adults we are.
Just ask the 1/6 patriots who got decades in the Gulag for TRESSPASSING.
Any violence would just confirm what Democrats already think of us.
But those jurors knew what party had the real radicals (Democrats). Probably why they were never going to acquit.
An acquittal was never the end game. They needed a decisive guilty verdict to parade and flaunt. That's what they were constantly after, and they needed a fully stacked deck to get it
It‚Äôs a lot like after the election, all the barricades, and all the plywood came down the moment they announced Biden had won. They knew damn well, who the plywood and the barricades in the security was for.
This case will be thrown out on appeals
And that's when we will see riots and burning buildings....by the left.
It doesn't matter...
CT senator Blumenthal for years claimed to be combat Vietnam vet, turns out he was never in the country.
He just "misspoke".
How many of current crop of democrats are actively full of shit and get a pass? Shiff has seen the evidence of Trump/Putin collusion...yea...ok. literally EVERYTHING Biden says etc.
The left doesn't care, they project and minimize.
Blumenthal never ran a national campaign. Waltz has a swiftboat problem.
Like #PedoJoe when he claimed to be first in his class. LMFAO
Ask WHY?
WHY was he demoted? "because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy," Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug√©, the Minnesota National Guard‚Äôs State Public Affairs Officer"
WHY did he not complete the coursework? Becasue he was notified in January of 2005 that his command was being deployed. By May he filed his papers to retire to avoid deploying.
So if he filed papers to retire then did he retire or not?
"Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate, was demoted and did not retire as a command sergeant major like he has claimed for years, including on his official gubernatorial biography."
Is this considered stolen valor? I‚Äôm not from a military background, hoping for some clarity.
A politician padding their credentials? That never happens. /SARCASM
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶?
Never stop pointing out lies even if it is a known occurrence in certain situations. The truth is the only thing we should care about.
