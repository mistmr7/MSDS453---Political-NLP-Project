Guys...that's not what happened at all. Here is an article with a link to the decision today. https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/supreme-court-leaves-bidens-title-ix-rule-fully-blocked-in-26-states/2024/08
In short, the title 9 rewrite is still in appeals court. The government wanted to force the non-controversial stuff (the stuff not in the lawsuit) to be implemented right away. The Supreme Court simply rejected the governments request. So basically non of the title 9 rewrite is implemented right now. Stuff like "schools to provide ‚Äúreasonable modifications‚Äù to pregnant students, including but not limited to ‚Äúbreaks during class to express breast milk, breastfeed, or attend to health needs associated with pregnancy or related conditions.‚Äù
The gender stuff was already on pause while the appeals courts handled the case (oral testimony in October).
Should be a 9-0 decision. This is a no brainer.
8-1. Remember one of them doesn't know what a woman is.
It is a no brainer and it was unanimous 9-0 on the key issues.
4 partially dissented because the balance of the rule that wasn‚Äôt challenged remained blocked. The majority stated that the rest hinged on the definitions etc that were struck down by all, and weren‚Äôt argued well to be separate issues that stand on their own.
https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/24a78_f2ah.pdf
Crazy that 4 of them voted in favour!!
Scary what the court would look like without Trump.
Remember that Jackson couldn‚Äôt even define what a woman was.
GOOD
Note that this was a ruling whether the Biden Administration could go ahead and begin enforcing the rule while the lawsuits continue through the lower courts. So this is not the final word on the matter.
So I‚Äôm watching an episode of Futurama from 2003. They are at the Olympics & Bender realizes he could never beat the top male robot in the Olympic Sport of bending. Then he discovers that there are Fembots so he disguises himself as a woman robot & easily wins 5 gold medals. When it‚Äôs time to test genders he has the professor change out his oil to that of woman‚Äôs oil to pass the test. He knows this is all temporary & that by pretending to be a woman he can easily win. Again, this ran in 2003!
I thought he was independent as of last year.
He ran as an independent because dems wouldn't run a fair primary. Even kicked him off the ballot
The left went so far left that normal democrats are now center/independent.
And on that same note - all of the past administration officials saying trump should never set foot in the Oval Office again‚Ä¶.
Fucking amen man. Amen
I love how RFK Jr‚Äôs family is pissed off about his values not ‚Äúaligning‚Äù with them. JFK would be absolutely appalled at what the democrat party has become.
Its like 3-4 Kennedy's that complained and those are working for liberal media or positions.  There are like 100s of them. 
But once you take the brain worms into account, I‚Äôm not so sure how much I trust his judgment
Yeah, but considering how many Republicans are supporting Harris, saying the same thing, maybe not the best thing to be pointing out.....
God bless our troops and God bless America.

3rd anniversary, so these dudes died under the Biden administration?
didn't you know Trump had arranged a withdrawal on a earlier date but when Biden got into office you know everything Trump did he reversed whether it was good or not. that's why this got fucked up. Biden has never called nor said the names of the dead soldiers. Trump has called each family üë™
Sorry to say this but Afghanistan was always going to go this route. It practically destroyed every other country that tried to occupy it. It could have been Trump, Biden or 7 presidents from now. Same thing. Afghanistan should be multiple different countries.
I feel horrible for the troops that ANYONE put them in that god awful mess of a country.
That country untamable.
I‚Äôll get hate for this and that‚Äôs fine. But these kids died for an un worthy cause. That country is a üí©hole.
As someone who has already had the privilege of experiencing my twenties I would say that this an absolute tragedy that these kids died. I feel disappointed in myself and my country. We the people keep shaking our fingers at the government‚Ä¶ but we already know that our government is terrible and corrupt. If we don‚Äôt do anything about it‚Ä¶..at some point we are all complicit.
Kamala is trash like most of Reddit
Those monsters in the white house chose to pull out of the nation in a horrible way, left billions in equipment behind, and left these honorable soldiers to fall. And those cowards can't even go to the memorial they caused. But Trump went, cause he actually gives a damn, God bless our soldiers, and Trump 2024.
Did u see the Military rally over there with the terrorists parading our equipment. It‚Äôs sad. The videos show a huge rally of Arabs parading our humvees, tanks, choppers like it‚Äôs theirs. All that we left. And the military says it was junked and non useful when they left. The terrorists say otherwise.
Maybe people should get back to choosing the best candidate instead of this identity bullshit we‚Äôve been going through
You guys may be surprised. I've been a lifelong Californian about 60 miles from 1 of the most progressive cities in the WORLD. And the number of people I come across on a daily basis who are Democrats voting Trump is pretty surprising.
I've worked in construction for the last 25 years and the jobsites I work on have predominantly Mexican workers. Many I know personally are both legal and illegal immigrants. I'm honestly shocked by how many lately are for Trump, regardless of their current situation.
I don't bring up politics at work, but they can see my bumper stickers and hear the conservative radio station I'm listening to, and they'll occasionally bring it up.
There's 3 underlying issues I hear amongst this crowd:
-They think Biden/Newsom uses them to get votes.
-They hate that their kids can get gender changing hormones without parental consent.
-They hate the high income taxes. (Believe it or not, even illegals pay income taxes in CA. They get worker ID numbers that substitute SSN.)
Definitely, there are many who drink the coolaid and ask me why I vote for a "bad guy." I've asked, what does he say that's so bad? What news station are you watching?"
"I don't watch the news." Well, that's the problem. Low information voters feel passionate about something they've never actually researched. They just blindly go with flow.
California is a long way from turning Red, but over the last 45 years, I've noticed a change.
I have a lot of family members who were Democrats since the 70s, who are now voting Trump. Not because they moved right but because the entire party has moved so far left.
I find this very hard to believe. I saw a similar Republicans for Harris sign on reddit recently. They're either fake or done by their respective party to try to sow discord.
Not hard for me to believe. The problem is that people don't realise its not republican vs dem. Its establishment vs populist anti establishment.
The cheneys and Romneys of the world want the same deep state establishment as Pelosi and schumer want.
The Trumps and Tucker calsons of world want the same anti establishment populist agenda as rfk Jr and tulsi gabbard.
The 2 parties are just how people have to choose their identity. But the two choices don't represent accurately the actual divide.
Austin is SO WEIRD. KeEp AuStIn WeIrD
based
I‚Äôm from NYC and the majority of people I know who voted for Biden are voting for Trump this time. People are very upset about the cost of living rising so dramatically here. The average rent in NYC is $4200 for a 1 bedroom. Average working folks just can‚Äôt afford to vote Democrat anymore.
you know it's bad when actual democrats think Trump is a better choice for the country than modern democrats
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a conservative and I‚Äôm voting for kamala‚Äù NO YOURE NOT. No sane conservative would ever choose the worse candidate, let alone one from the other party
What's really bad is this kind of comment, anything questioning actually, is sensored on the Democrats reddit. I was one and try to ask tough questions but no luck their. At least here with Republicans free speech is honored.

You have to show an ID to attend the DNC. DEMOCRATS know IDs and walls work
They like to pretend we're back in 1900 when IDs didn't really exist. Back in the day they'd roll out this 100 year old grandma without an ID in a wheelchair and say that we're taking away their ability to vote.
Needless to say they need to be laughed out of the room now!
Problem is their voters are too delusional to see this.
Now let's file lawsuits in any other states with loopholes in place also.
This
Why in the f@ck should it even have got that far?!?!?
This should not be news, but unfortunately it is! Such an obvious policy to have in place.
Now make a law or establish to punish for failure to enforce! I've offered to show many times and no takers!
Meanwhile EVERYONE forgets Ukraine gave up nukes with the promise that we would watch out for them in the event of a military conflict.
Every country should be able to defend itself
I just want to say hi to a fellow Georgian.
Hi :3
Trump sided with Putin when Putin said Russia didn‚Äôt interfere with the US elections despite what every US intelligence agency reported in a global press conference. He gave Putin any specter of credibility and loyalty Trump may have had to the United States. His admin made him moonwalk the statement back the next day it was so egregious.
You fucking asshats can go get eaten by some leopards, Trump is your downfall. I don‚Äôt necessarily like any of those previous presidents either, and I don‚Äôt care for Kamala, but dedication to a malignant narcissist in cognitive decline is beyond troubling.
I was more than willing to give him a chance many times over, but he has run out of feet to stick in his mouth. No more of this bullshit.
As if Crimea is not Ukraine.
Putin‚Äôs Carlson interview shows the links between Trump talk and Russian messaging

That‚Äôs Putin it mildly.


if you go to r/pics and post a picture of a George Floyd statue and say it was a cult they will call you racist and ban you. the sub is 100% mods brainwashing people and controlling people with different beliefs
thats pretty much all of reddit
I find it funny how people will posts about how much the right is obsessed with trump then if you go on there page almost all they posted is about trump and somehow they can‚Äôt see they are also weirdly obsessed with him
i guess the breaking bad statues in albuquerque are a cult too
Gawd, I'm so sick of George Floyd. They want so desperately to make it sound like he was on his way to church when he got attacked by the police. Instead of passing fake money, and he was strung out on Fentanyl, when he got stopped.
Right! He also pulled out a gun on a pregnant woman and people think he‚Äôs a hero
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs grounds to kill someone or treat them inhumanly. Sure he should be stopped. We can agree on that
Since Reddit is full of unconvertible leftists, it doesn't matter what we say here it's not going to change their minds, ever.
Fortunately, Reddit does not speak for the entire nation, it is a very vocal left-wing wacko liberal segment of the population, but no way is it a majority of the people.
So let them say what they're going to say and post what they're going to post. In the long run, it doesn't really make much of it actual difference in real life.
Reddit is just a leftwing circle jerk. If we stop caring about what they think, they lose all power. Bet they think they are hot shit with 50k upvotes. Reality is that 50k doesn't hold a candle in the wind to the actual 100+ million that we stand with. Fuck what they think, and fuck their internet points.
Do we know for a fact this is real? Seems odd a family would make t shirts saying familyname's for politicalcandidate.
If it is real, who wants to take a stab at posting it to r/pics and see how long before it's removed for being political
If it were real, I would think they would know how to pluralize their last name.
It‚Äôs really obvious what r/pics does, as soon as Biden dropped out that subreddit started posting pics of trumps inauguration, the j. 6 riots, and the debunked photo of trump with Epstein. Like okay I get it you‚Äôre a leftist subreddit on a leftist platform and the person you have to vote for sucks so you immediately start posting anti conservative content.
I for one am tired of this, I see so many people posting here about how they get banned from that subreddit for the smallest things, meanwhile I take my time to report any post that I think is pro leftism and I bet you can guess the results of their inquiry into the reported post was every single time.
Bet I‚Äôll post it right now and set a timer to see how little time they take to remove it
This would get TONS of news coverage if the parties were reversed. And for any liberals passing through who don't believe me, just recall all the coverage Kellyanne Conway's husband got.
Didn't RFK jrs family also oppose him recently?
Edit: My point is no one really gave a shit still as this person implied. Families disagree all the time.
I wonder if Trump will invite them on a stage
I tried putting in R/pics removed instantly
Imagine the atmosphere around this Thanksgiving.


Burn an American flag, Israeli flag, nobody cares. Burn a pride flag and everyone acts like you murdered someone in the street
It's so sad that so many kids dismiss civics class in high school (if it's even offered). Civics usually includes flag law, and touches on important things about our nation.
Like. You're taught how our country runs. You sit in free (don't quibble, you know what I mean) education classes no matter who you are, where you're from, how much money you have. You're a kid provided with education about your country & in civics class, you learn about free speech
If you're lucky, you learn about burning an American flag. Maybe you're executed, maybe you're a hero, maybe you're case law.
An American flag isn't just a decoration. It's a symbol, & has legal protections. The weird stripey sex flag is ...just some random party decorationn about who you want to have sex with
How are the two things the same?
I loathe what the far left is doing to our country.
Makes my blood boil. These people are terrorists. They must be deported to Gaza
This is vandalism, why were they not arrested and charged? These monuments are old and restoration is expensive. The capital police and their masters are a joke. Anti American all around shit show.
Terrorist sympathizers.
You burn American flags on American soil. You are a terrorist, not just a sympathizer
‚ÄúHamas is coming.‚Äù lol. BET. Hamas is lucky they havent been vaporized into the Mediterranean.
Free the people who want to murder Jews and say death America. Nope
Theyre so brainwashed they are calling for peace in Gaza (free palestine), calling for the end of israel and Jews, (genocide), and even go so far as to say that all of the Israelis murdered and taken hostage deserved it for being Jewish.
These people are fucked in the head.
Can I get a fact check please
On aisle 1 - fact check please!!
Is this the only subreddit that has JD Vance as the winner lastnight???
It's the Vance Glance
There are people that actually try to justify Tim walz won the debate here on Reddit.
This really makes me not like Reddit, the level of delusion and mental gymnastics you need to go through to justify walz winning is mental health level scary.
He got absolutely spanked by Vance
Yeah Reddit is so far left it‚Äôs wild to see.
Walz will be voting for Vance. He practically agreed on multiple points Vance was making.
First time? Reddit is full of Dems. We‚Äôre behind enemy lines.üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Off-topic but, in these couple months of him being VP candidate he started to look older. I bet he‚Äôs going through a lot
‚ÄúImma just let slide the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm friends with school shooters‚Äô but y‚Äôall heard it right?‚Äù
I‚Äôll never understand why a celebrity endorsement for a presidential campaign means anything. Except to the gullible.
To be fair, trump did post an AI Taylor Swift endorsement of him. No matter her political leanings, I‚Äôm sure that was annoying as hell. She likely wasn‚Äôt going to publicly endorse anyone, but after that she had to come out and publicly endorse someone.
To be fair, Donald Trump does name drop people who love him literally all the time‚Ä¶ so like, I think it might matter to him a little bit
The GOP candidate is literally a celebrity.
As a 29 year old woman who is both a Taylor Swift fan and a conservative, I am begging Republican men to stop being so fucking embarrassing.
I guarantee the majority of you did not give a single shit about TS before last year, when conservative media realized they could also cash in on her name and popularity with low-quality rage bait articles. My dad couldn‚Äôt have named a single song of hers but suddenly last year he was an expert on her and why she was such a horrible example üôÑ.
It‚Äôs also hilarious because she‚Äôs one of the tamest (some would even say bland) celebrities out there. If the worst you can come up with is that she has cats, and has dated lots of men then sorry but you‚Äôre only making yourself look bad. I don‚Äôt care if you hate her music, that‚Äôs fine. Everyone has their own taste and music is subjective.
But y‚Äôall need to realize that insulting and belittling women (especially one who is extremely successful and who has never even had a major scandal) is not a winning strategy and will only further alienate and drive women away from conservatism and the Republican Party. I‚Äôve been conservative my whole life. I know my values and priorities when voting, but I want nothing to do with the incels in this thread, and for anyone on the fence, this is the kind of stuff that alienates people.
Do better.
I am a 22 year old conservative male and also a swifty. I have enjoyed her music since i was a kid and still do. I get made fun of. Shes successful. Idk why you cant enjoy some music üòÇ
Welp, it was a good run. GGs everyone, better luck next time. The true world leader has spoken.


It‚Äôd be awesome if he actually debates about these instead of just falling into traps that lead no where
Ok but HOW will he get these things done is what I‚Äôm more interested in.
Yes. Do tell - HOW?
‚ÄúEnd inflation.‚Äù You don‚Äôt just end inflation. Think for just a second about the myriad factors that influence inflation. I mean, come on.
I wish politicians spoke in SMART goals. None of this means a thing without facts and figures.
S - specific M - measurable A - attainable R - relevant T - time-based
I feel like 20 is an arbitrary number and half these items can be combined down to 8
12... isn't our military already bigger and stronger than the next 4 or 5 largest militaries combined?
Iron dome missle defense shield?
I assume it's supposed to be like the one in Israel, but that wouldn't work against icbms right? It's too fast, it's for stuff like cruise missiles
Working in a fortune 100 tech company, I‚Äôve seen a huge focus within the industry on hiring in India vs the USA. This has to be addressed.
If you‚Äôre not willing to raise the retirement age for later generations or reduce their benefits, then the only way to ensure the solvency of Social Security is to raise taxes.
If you were born a male you have no business playing in women's sports - PERIOD.
Good for them. This is the only way that womens' sports can be reclaimed for women.
It‚Äôs women‚Äôs sports for a reason. Imagine if you could identify as disabled and go to the Paraolympics
It‚Äôs a shame that this is what it‚Äôs come to
Time to end this fad of men in women‚Äôs sports.
Good for them. 
From National Review: "Boise State is now the second team to forfeit a match with San Jos√© State; Southern Utah University opted out of playing a September 14 match against the California university."
Hopefully this trend will continue. It's so obviously unfair and ridiculous that the NCAA allows this.
No men allowed.
Good for them!
Let‚Äôs hear from you, feminists.
Feminist here! And I support this.
So you dont think any other Democrat should have run against Joe Biden in the Primary? No Democrat thought he/she could do a better job? At least the Republicans give their party a choice.
Trump is a threat to democracy!
and that's all. you don't need to go any further. They will either say Project 2025 (which isn't his plan), that he's a felon (ask them the exact reason why an 8 year old misdemeanor was suddenly turned into a felony and they won't know), or that he's dangerous and wants revenge (makes no sense)
I am guessing this will get deleted, but if you're asking for an honest opinion, I'll give you one.
Trump lost in 2020, but he didn't accept that he lost. He asked his own justice department to look into it, and they did. They came back and said, "Yes, you lost. " He didn't accept that answer, and everything that we all know followed: Jan 6th, the alternate electors, everything.
That alone threatens democracy to me: You know you lost, but you do everything possible to change the election anyway.
Or my personal favorite, ‚Äúif he wanted to be a dictator why would he wait until his unassured second term?‚Äù
Or they say he‚Äôs a convicted rapist.
Just ask what Kamala is bringing to the table....they won't know that either, they deflect back to Trump....
Technically US primaries are not covered by the constitution or federally mandated at all. Some states started them in the early 1900s, but didnt become mainstream until post WW2. Even then, theres many cases where delegates nominate the party member who didn't even win the election.
It's all a sham.
Our tax plan is awful right now‚Ä¶
I think it‚Äôs less about why every democrat likes Kamala and much more about why they despise Trump. You‚Äôve got to remember, all of us get our news from somewhere, if you‚Äôre watching Fox or CNN and really think you‚Äôre the most educated voter, you might want to take a look at what you‚Äôre absorbing. It‚Äôs all nonsensical political theater.
Democrats aren‚Äôt stupid just for being democrats like so many people here like to insinuate. The same goes for republicans, it‚Äôs based on moral values and what policy we agree with.
The average voter is woefully uneducated in politics, how can you make sure that‚Äôs not you? Thats what we should be asking and less of this party vs party bs.
Because the party of hate doesn't vote for people anymore. Only against.
In all fairness looking from outside (abroad) inwards I think the downfall of USA would be having Trump. The reason is he shoots from the hip too much. If you could make him a statesman maybe just maybe he would get alot more votes.
This election is either the death of trumpism or trump will run usa in his own image (for better or worse).
You're confusing his public demeanor with his diplomacy. The reality is that his diplomacy while in office, usually worked.
He frightened NATO members into increasing their defense spending - which they are very glad now that he did.
He got historic peace accords across the world, avoided getting the US into new wars, got us out of wars we had been in, and made good trade agreements.
One of the few failures was when he warned Europe against becoming dependent on Russian natural gas. They laughed at him.
...and he was proved correct there also.
She is the greatest, most qualified candidate in the history of American politics and will soon REPLACE george washington on mount Rushmore !
The DNC delegates voted on it, no?
Yes. The party elites hid Joe's senility for 4 years, ensured Joe had no meaningful competition in the primaries, continued to hide Joe's senility through the primaries when Democrat voters could have made a better choice, and then decided to get rid of Joe... not because he was senile and unable to do the job. They'd known that for years. They got rid of him after the primaries because he was going to lose.
Then they selected his replacement without input from voters.
The average democrat is an indoctrinated hypocrite, who follows the party line blindly.
This is the most mind bending part of it. They really are so indoctrinated that they‚Äôll just toss aside any common logic or thought process just to jump in line.
They are, but they aren't covering it in that context. They're all calling it "far-right" riots.
Came to say this. They call it ‚Äúfar right violence‚Äù in the articles I‚Äôve seen.
Probably because it might get Americans thinking about how angry they are that illegal immigrants are overwhelming ours.
The left doesn't want more right wing political parties to form, and making people think "They let criminals across the border" is a common sentiment might galvanize the right.
Media doesn't want to disclose that it might actually be a real issue.
Ghosting only works with a controlled source of information.
If other countries are having this issue, then it is real, and ghosting fails.
Because it really grinds our gears
You know why. They want the same shit to happen here. And it will if we keep sitting dormant.
It already has lol
Because that would ruin the democRat narrative
I believe they don't mind the immigration in general as much as the violence and crime that immigrants brought with them from Muslim countries
Or why they don't call for more punishment for government officials caught cheating the system?
It's insane when they try to claim immunity for official acts ü§Ø
Don't even get me started on the FL representative that was trafficking minors ü§¢
Why did republicans block their own border bill earlier this year so that this issue could continue to be a dog whistle to stir up rage and sentiment leading up to the election?
Almost no shootings are caused by guns. I suppose it is possible for a gun to go off on its own and shoot someone, but I've never heard of it.
Saying that shootings are caused by guns is like saying DUIs are caused by cars.
Shootings are not ‚Äúcaused by guns‚Äù they‚Äôre caused by mentally ill people who choose to commit such acts. What our country fails at is addressing the mental illness epidemic we having going on & we‚Äôre not doing anything about it. A gun doesn‚Äôt just get up by itself & walk into a school & kill innocent people.
All shootings are caused by a crazy person. I have guns. They have never walked out of the safe on their own and shot people. Illegal immigrants are criminals by the fact that they are here illegally. What other crime is needed before the initial crime is dealt with
The mental gymnastics happening to justify protecting guns when kids die, is still shocking to me.
So dumb
Careful, you might turn into U/Deleted with this one.
Ok I‚Äôm not fan of hers but what did she do to damage democracy in 2021?
Joe was senile in 2020, and has gotten progressively worse. Everyone around him knew this, and the media took pains to hide it.
The number one thing she did to damage Democracy in 2021 was not expose this and remove him via the 25th Amendment.
With that out of the way, someone has been running the US government for the last 3.5 years, and it hasn't been Joe.
So, either all the things that the Biden-Harris administration have done over that time to damage Democracy have been on Harris...
...or someone else has been running the government, and there is absolutely no reason to believe Harris would be running it in 2025 if elected.
I hate Kamala but Trump didn't do a good job either
Love how every cartoon portrays her as completely insane
This is the worst made-up "nothing" scenario comic I've ever seen.
This was a result of Trumps tax plan, keeping rates at 0% and pushing out stimulus checks.
So the taxpayer subsidizes Israel‚Äôs weapons. The weapons we the taxpayer purchased are then used to destroy Lebanese infrastructure and then we pay for the rebuild too.
‚ÄòNation building‚Äô
What's good for Lockheed Martin is good for Georgia Pacific.
It‚Äôs called double dipping
its iraq and afghansistan all over again lol.
No wonder Dick Chenys backing her; he probably still gets royalties of Haliburtons subsidiaries .
So aid for our enemies but not our citizens
If you think this will stop people from voting for her, you underestimate the idiocy of humanity.
She is a total commie tool
Would like to see how dems react to this. What rational would they come up with to make this seem ok?
Is this real? Man I live in Erwin, TN - ground zero of hurricane floods. GIVE US THE MONEY
Also, "I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!"
Broooo go on the Taylor swift subreddit, it‚Äôs nothing but Trump hate lmao I went on there, read one comment -‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre we gonna do about this swifties?! I‚Äôll tell you what we‚Äôll do, we‚Äôll march right down to the polls!‚Äù ‚ò†Ô∏è
EDIT: As if they weren‚Äôt going to do that anyhow, and a lot of her followers can‚Äôt even vote üòÇ
Bro is out here just trying to golf and yell about illegals. Leave him alone.
Sounds like most of the old golfers at my club. Harmless unless you get behind their 6 person dog fight and the refuse to let you play through. At that point, I understand the violence
I know this isn‚Äôt the dankmemes sub, but
It ain't much but it's honest work
Wait I‚Äôm confused what does Taylor swift got to do with the assassination attempt?
Nothing
The sad (and scary) answer, is: no. They won‚Äôt stop until he‚Äôs dead. And their reaction to each attempt proves this.
They‚Äôre getting desperate for votes, since they‚Äôre losing in all the polls
Just shows the level of intelligence and leadership in the left.
When a conservative says something, we're called conspiracy theorists. Then, when the facts come to life and its proven to be true, they call us haters, racists and anything else they can think of because they live in a fantasy world.
These people are socialists. These are not the democrats of the 60s and 70s....and need to be stopped.
As a Gen-Zer how were the Dems like in the 60s & 70s?
There‚Äôs no issue at the border either, but she‚Äôs going to fix that too.
For 3 years, you could show video of thousands trying to cross and liberals called it fake.
Now, it's Trumps fault.
Funny, I thought the issues were fake ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It is kind of curious how Kamala is running on doing all of the things her supporters spent the past near 4 years insisting that the president has absolutely no control over.
so you are going to lie and tell everybody you are going to fix something that is not broken and that she has been part of for the last 3+ years. Why the hell would anybody vote for 4 more year of this crap!!
because CNN and MSNBC are making this "Election" all about race,gender, and abortion
That‚Äôs the logic of the left. It‚Äôs like they all share the same failing brain.
They're all sheep
but they insist on ‚Äúnot going back‚Äù i don‚Äôt understand. they are actually so fucking stupid
For real. I‚Äôm a moderate that tilts right wing, but will gladly say fuck Alex Jones.
It‚Äôs the grumpy conservatives version of The Yung Turks.
Doesn‚Äôt look great for our side. I wish we could just keep things civil.
You know they are at the top of their game when they get their news from Infowars! Definitely the trusted source I'm listening to!!!
except it's a true statement and not talking about Monica Lewinsky
He delivered a speech didn‚Äôt he? He has his hands all over this campaign.
Did this really happen?
Didn‚Äôt have to put infowars on the shirt
I bet Bill was really disappointed to see that play out.


Moderators ban conservatives.
Got perma banned from whitepeopletwitter for commenting ‚ÄúThanks, I just registered Republican‚Äù
This. Not just on political subs, either. I got banned from r/weird for calling someone weird for saying they won't shop at a store they used to love because the store now sells Trump flags. It was a freaking flag store! I told them they should stop shopping at Amazon too because they also sell Trump flags.
Anyway, I got a permaban, and the mods called me a fascist. I didn't even say anything pro-Trump.
I got banned in the technology reddit because they were blasting the Republicans for some FCC decision. All I did was state what Biden actually did and poof I was out in an instant. I tried to get back in, they refused. Go visit the political reddit, OMG extreme liberals over there. There is no logic with them, post proof Harris or Biden lied and it's fake news.
It wasn‚Äôt always. So many conservative sub reddits got banned over night. Conservative comments got deleted and the users banned. Also so many sub reddits blocked anyone that was also participating in a conservative subreddit from entering. For example I couldn‚Äôt join a gardening subreddit because I was subscribed to a trump supporting subreddit. Basically discrimination. Which caused many conservatives to leave or become silent. Which was ultimately the goal.
They preach inclusion but love to exclude
I got like 300 negative likes because I said communism failed
Believe it or not; Reddit wasn‚Äôt always this way. It‚Äôs become a very liberal platform. For news I generally use X (Twitter). Telegram is full of conspiracy theorists, can hardly rely on that either
Remember when they had to reengineer the r/all algorithm dozens of times because right-leaning posts kept making it onto the frontpage?


Who are "they/them"?
I assume the other half of the Republican Party who‚Äôs been shunned for not supporting Trump.
And or whatever few Mike pence fans who were turned off by Trump almost having him and his family killed on the 6th
There is no they/them. It was a single person. Stop politicizing an evil thing. No one should be killed for politics, no one.
Very questionable account posting here
Why does he have tits? Maybe the estrogen is kicking in
NGL, those tits look really similar to mine, and I‚Äôm a woman.
It should be a billboard.
I'll donate!
Trump has literally experienced as many assassination attempts as Harris has experienced interviews.
no way harris had only two?? that blows my mind
That‚Äôs true! God is watching over Trump to survive two attempts.
That is fucking hilarious....and true
I LOVE VENN DIAGRAMS!!!!!!!!!! ü§°
Sad but true, and neither are necessary. And counterproductive
My favorite diagram!
Actual humor. ü§å


I am legit surprised why they even let Peter Doucy in the building let alone let him sit down and ask questions. The man is a national treasure.
It‚Äôs sad that they always give him non-answers. The idiot press secretary is the worst culprit.
OP, given the number of people in this thread that think this exchange actually happened, are you sure you want to throw stones?
This isn‚Äôt from the same time/place

This isn't real.
I don‚Äôt understand how this woman hasn‚Äôt done one press conference yet
They were convinced Biden was gonna be amazing and he didn‚Äôt even have a campaign. They have them brainwashed is all there is to it, Kamala went from the least popular VP in history to ‚Äúshe‚Äôs gonna save America‚Äù overnight. Don‚Äôt forget they went straight communist this go around also, just push Joe out and tell their voters it‚Äôs Kamala, they just suck that shit up, not a word!
Because she can‚Äôt. She can‚Äôt do it without sounding like a damn fool and revealing her extremism and lack of answers. So they are playing keep away.
I don‚Äôt like Biden either but this just isn‚Äôt true.
He ordered federal assistance for Florida almost a week ago, lol. He approved a disaster declaration. No leader with common sense or decency would just leave them to suffer. I‚Äôm just being objective, here‚Ä¶He already stated he was going to visit the impacted communities this week. They‚Äôre just trying to avoid disrupting emergency response operations. This is public information. Not a republican or a democrat, I literally read this in the newspaper‚Ä¶
I agree, do NOT like Biden but there are things Washington needs to work together on. This falls squarely on the shoulders of All federal politicians.

The federal government has, since 2017 and excluding COVID spending, spent $125 billion (or 15.6b per year) on disasters.
In that same time, FL, GA, NC, and SC have received $23.4 billion of that spending, or about 19%. For comparison, those states have a population of about 47.7 million, or 14.5% of the US.
thank you for having a brain
Congress just passed the stopgap funding bill with no additional disaster funds; which were primarily opposed by our own Republican legislators. I‚Äôm all for hating on Biden here, but Congress had an opportunity to do this before the hurricane hit and chose not to act.

This might as well be a Facebook group.
Literally people posting this uneducated garbage all the time. I didn't realize so many Republicans are brainless.
ok to be fair its not $2.8M in cash on wooden palates its $2.8M in old American ammo which cost less to have it shipped and used up in Ukraine then it does to safely destroy it in the us cause the us has so much stored ammo its impossible for it to use it all up in training
When the VP is elected alongside a POTUS who was already senile when he was campaigning in 2020 and has been getting worse, and when the VP chooses to hide that instead of using the 25th Amendment to replace him.
Someone has been running the country and it isn't Joe. If it is Kamala, then everything that has been happening for the last 3-1/2 years is on her.
If it isn't Kamala, then there is no reason to believe that she would be running the country if elected.
You‚Äôre dealing with a cult, not rational players.
Maybe the truth is that presidents don‚Äôt really do amazing things.
Don't forget democrats will use congress as an excuse as to why nothing has been done, even though they sidestep congress daily. That, or complain about the Supreme Court, simply because it isn't 100% liberal. Regardless, there's always some excuse or deflection.
I mean, it's kinda hard to argue.
How true!!!
Usually when I see these things I just tell them I vote based on my wallet. I am within 20 years of full retirement and have had a 401k for 18 years. The only time my 401k gained (percentage wise) 15%+ was when Trump was president. 23% in 2017, 27% in 2018, 21% in 2019 and 13% in 2020 (after having about a half year of negative because of pandemic). Biden was 11% in 2021, -8% (yes NEGATIVE), 9% in 2022, 13% in 2023 and this year 14%. The 5 years I had a 401k under Obama was always above 10% but below 15%. I was actually OK with that, but when Trump got into office he was on another level % wise gains.
Why didn‚Äôt he solve immigration, healthcare while he was president? I forgot. Or what was his immigration and healthcare plan? He had four years and he was president.
Well‚Ä¶we‚Äôre still in Trump‚Äôs tax plan until 2025 so there‚Äôs that.
