NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
Who is Kamala Harris?
Despite an uptick in interviews several weeks on the stump three years as vice president months
spent campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 four years as a senator and
seven as California attorney general many Americans still don?t think they know the ""real"" Kamala
Harris.
How can that be? Remaining undefined after all this time as a public figure is astonishing. Equally
shocking is Harris? obvious terror of being in the spotlight. That?s the only plausible explanation for
the ""word salads"" that are tossed to interviewers when a teleprompter goes missing. Or the ill-timed
bursts of laughter meant to cover her anxiety.
As Maureen Dowd wrote recently in The New York Times ""Even when getting softballs from
supportive TV hosts Harris at times seemed unsure of how to answer.""
VP KAMALA HARRIS TO SIT DOWN WITH CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR BRET BAIER FOR
FIRST FORMAL FOX NEWS INTERVIEW
True she did well during her debate against former President Donald Trump but that performance
required weeks of rehearsal and memorization a giant assist from partisan moderators and ? let?s
be honest ? an inexpert opponent.
Why is Harris so insecure? One possibility is that it is because she knows she is not qualified andthat she has landed on this lofty perch for all the wrong reasons. That she became V.P. because
Joe Biden had promised to pick a woman of color and not because of her accomplishments. And
that she was tapped to be the 2024 nominee because Democrat pooh-bahs realized a diminished
Biden could not beat Donald Trump and ran out of time to find someone better.
Another explanation is that Kamala Harris is pretending to be something she is not: a moderate
politician. She may be struggling to mask her progressive beliefs the ones she ran on
unsuccessfully in 2019. Her father was a Marxist economist and her mother a liberal activist; both
presumably had some influence on their daughter as she grew up in San Francisco.
Harris has said her core values have not changed but that would suggest that her flip-flopping on
important issues like fracking and Medicare-for-All are political gambits meant to reassure critical
centrist voters. After all she didn?t hold leftist opinions in college; she held them just five years ago.
To broaden her appeal she may be lying about a great many things; that would make anyone
uncomfortable.
AXELROD SAYS ?UPSCALE? NC HARRIS VOTERS WILL FIND WAY TO VOTE AFTER STORM
NOT SURE ABOUT RURAL TRUMP FANS
A third possibility is that the vice president has no core beliefs no central well of values that would
inform her policies. The late President Reagan believed in small government and peace through
strength; Donald Trump echoes those ideas and in addition believes in putting America first. The
Times? David Brooks suggests that Harris ""needs to show the American people her strongest most
acute and controlling desire the ruling passion of her soul."" It?s quite possible she doesn?t have
one.Her party is panicking as the inadequacies of their candidate become more obvious. Like sports fans
tossing water bottles to a bedraggled marathoner Democrats are bombarding Kamala with advice.
Recent polls suggest she may lose to Donald Trump they are desperate to help.
Maureen Dowd writing in the New York Times says Harris must ""distance herself from Biden when
she needs to?"" and ""make the case for herself more assertively."" Harris does not know how to make
the case at all much less ""assertively.""
James Carville the wily old Democrat kingmaker says the VP ""should scare the crap out of voters.""
That?s hard to do that when you?re scared yourself.
JAMES CARVILLE ADMITS HE'S 'SCARED TO DEATH' ABOUT ELECTION DAY
New York Times Opinion columnist and author Charles Blow hilariously opines that Harris doesn?t
need to ""pull back from conveying joy"" but quotes a pollster as saying she must ""layer specific
issues like housing affordability and health care ""under the overarch of joy."" Blow says ""The
campaign doesn?t need a post-joy strategy but it definitely needs an ""in- addition-to-joy strategy.""
Imagine an adult actually writing those words.
My favorite advice to Harris though comes from Jonathan Martin who writes in Politico that Kamala
""ought to consider preemptively naming Mitt Romney as her Secretary of State"" asking ""what better
way to convey to middle-of-the-road voters that you mean what you say about putting Republicans
in your government?"" That despite Romney refusing to endorse Harris.

she wanted to be president what her top priorities would be and how she would get that stuff done.
The Vision Thing."" Dowd must know there?s a good chance that Harris doesn?t have a vision.
Democrats are anxious but have only themselves to blame. After pushing Joe Biden out of the race
and seeing their party rush to embrace the usurper party leaders thought they had the Oval Office
in the bag. Trump after all was a convicted felon who threatened democracy and wanted to ban
abortions nationwide. That was their (dishonest) story and they were convinced it was enough to
repeat the 2020 win.
Voters though wanted more. And especially? more from Kamala Harris. For a while the excitement
of the convention and her inaugural appearances masked frustration with her unrevealing campaign.
But very soon her refusal to take interviews and shunning of non-scripted moments of any kind grew
stale; while COVID made it easy for Joe Biden to hide in his basement similarly avoiding scrutiny
Harris has no such excuse.
With polls tightening her team is trying anything and everything to regain her momentum. They set
her up for a flurry of interviews most of which were so bad they ended up featured in Trump-Vance
ads.

Her admission to the hosts of the View that she would not change a single policy or action of
Biden?s over the past three and a half years was the corker; even former Obama senior adviser
David Axelrod called it the worst of all possible responses.Given her vow that ""We?re Not Going Back"" he is right. Sticking with the policies that have
delivered so many failures over the past three years shows Harris is also not inclined to move
forward.

1,Conservative,FOX News,"5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview
Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday when she
dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.
With less than a month before the election CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed
Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals on whether President Biden's loose
immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or
former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up
questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.
Overall the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running
mate the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival former President
Trump backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes"" though the Trump campaign said
there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.
Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.
?60 MINUTES? ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A ?MISTAKE? FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO
SOFT ON BORDER VP REPEATEDLY DODGES
1. Harris' foreign policy would track with Biden's
Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe with Israel
under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In
her answers Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current
administration.On Israel Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end though she acknowledged the
Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7 2023 massacre when terrorists slaughtered
1200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.
""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many
innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end"" Harris said.
Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in
military aid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris
administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over
Netanyahu Harris dodged the question and stayed on message emphasizing the current
administration's diplomatic efforts.
""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around
making clear our principles"" she said.
KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH ?THE VIEW?
STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN
Whitaker pressed ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""
Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the
United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""
On Europe Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to thewar with Russia.
""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in
what that success looks like"" she said.
In a definitive statement Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to
discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However she was less
specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.
""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now we are
supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression"" Harris said.
""Donald Trump if he were president Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about oh he
can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""
TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO ?60 MINUTES? INTERVIEW AFTER CBS
NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT
2. Harris would not answer for Biden's record on immigration
Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration noting that she supported
Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed
the border. Now the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum
seekers"" he said.
Whitaker asked ""If that's the right answer now why didn't your administration take those steps in
2021?""Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan
agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got
word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing
a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward"" she said.
However Whitaker pushed back on the vice president observing that in the first three years of the
Biden-Harris administration border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or
Harris.
""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""
Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from
day one literally.""
""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem"" she said again echoing Biden.
3. Harris would raise taxes to pay for her $3 trillion economic plan
To fight inflation Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for
food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6000 give first-time homebuyers
$25000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small
business.
The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of
her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.
""Okay so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined
that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy his would weaken it"" Harris
answered. ""But my plan Bill if you don't mind my plan is about saying that when you invest in small
businesses you invest in the middle class and you strengthen America's economy. Small
businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""
HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND
ECONOMIC PLAN
Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me madam vice president. The question was how are you going
to pay for it?""
The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""
""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires
and the biggest corporations and I plan on making that fair"" Harris asserted.
Whitaker followed up again stating ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that
Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.
""I disagree with you"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand
and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""""None of us and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening
America's economy"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You
know that I am also a capitalist and I know the limitations of government.""
4. Harris says she is a gun owner and that she owns a Glock
After a discussion on foreign policy Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her
recent admission that she is a gun owner.
""I have a Glock and I've had it for quite some time"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she
owns. ""And I mean look my background is in law enforcement and so there you go.""
Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney
general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's
2020 running mate.
She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

5. Harris addresses voter uncertainty about her
Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president she remains
a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic
primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago when Biden decided to drop out
of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know
what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""
""It's an election Bill"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This
is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they
can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support.
""You have to earn it. And that's what I intend to do.""",FOX News_5_key_takeaways_from_Kamala_Harris___60_Minutes__i.pdf.pdf,news_articles

6,Conservative,FOX News,"Ambitions hopes dreams aspirations boys playing girls' sports
and reparations
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
Vice President Kamala Harris has so over-used her talking points about ""growing up in a
middle-class family"" and about her ""love of the American people and our ""hopes dreams ambitions
and aspirations"" that they have become punch lines to jokes.
That?s not a good macro-political sign for her presidential campaign. And neither are some of the
numbers emerging from the smaller demographics she must have to win. One of those smaller units
of the American electorate are the Arab Americans generally and in Michigan specifically and the
news isn?t great for Team Harris there either.
In early October the Arab American Institute released its poll of Arab Americans on the upcoming
presidential election. The ""top line"" takeaway was very surprising: ""Trump and Harris [are] in a
virtual tie with Arab American voters (42-41%) with 12% supporting third-party candidates.""
I asked former President Trump why he was doing this well with this demographic especially at the
same time as his support among Jewish Americans is increasing?
""Because I want to see everything get worked out"" he replied. ""I want peace"" he continued. ""I
don?t want to see people killed. I want peace and they [Arab Americans] know that. And the Jewish
people know that. And both sides like it and know that I can get peace.""
That?s a good answer and perhaps it does account for a good chunk of some Arab Americans
voting Trump but the same poll revealed that when ""asked to rank their top issues the followingwere the top three for Arab American voters: jobs and the economy (39%) Gaza (26%) and gun
violence (21%).""
Turns out that this demographic cares the most about the same issue the entire electorate cares the
most about: The economy. There was no cross-tab provided on how the 39% break down between
Trump and Harris but my guess is that as with the electorate as a whole Arab Americans who are
worried about inflation and their jobs break for Trump.
NEW POLL SHOWS HARRIS TRUMP SPLITTING TWO KEY STATES
Then there are the issues that very few pollsters ask about and which this poll didn?t. The first is
""transgender rights"" which can mean a lot of things to different people. But to at least many millions
of voters it means this: Boys who identify as girls playing in girls' sports and using girls' locker
rooms.
The second issue not often polled is ""reparations."" This issue was introduced into the campaign just
this week when Vice President Harris was asked about reparations by podcaster ""Charlamagne tha
God"" and the Democrat nominee declared the issue ""needed to be studied.""
""Americans view the prospect of reparations mostly negatively"" according to a 2021 Pew Research
Study. ""Three-in-ten U.S. adults say descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should be repaid in
some way such as given land or money"" Pew reported. 77% of Black Americans support
reparations while only 39% of Hispanic Americans and 33% of Asian Americans do. (Arab
Americans were not broken out in the polling.)
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWhat about the first issue mentioned above? A super-majority of all Americans?69% according to
Gallup?believe that ""transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that
conform with their birth gender."" But the Biden-Harris Administration has proposed new Title IX rules
that have been widely viewed as mandating the right of transgender athletes to compete in the
sports reserved for the biological category they identify with. To most voters that probably means
""boys who identify as girls playing girls sports.""
While Harris has not spoken to this specific issue she has adopted the very controversial position of
taxpayer payment for prison inmates seeking to transition from one sex to another. (The Trump
campaign has made Harris?s on-the-record support for these taxpayer payments part of their ad
rotation.)
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
It is a guess but a safe one that conservative family cultures of the sort typical for Arab
Americans?Muslim Christian or agnostic?largely reject both reparations for Blacks and the idea of
biological boys playing in girls' sports.
That?s an informed guess because the Arab American Institute polling demonstrated that Arab
Americans are in fact like most Americans on what matters most. Don?t be surprised when the
post-election exit polling reveals that Arab Americans ended up supporting Trump in roughly the
same percentage as all Americans and that they viewed Vice President Harris as simply too radical
to take a chance on.

MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell said on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling to
resonate with White and Black male voters.
Michell said on ""Meet the Press"" that Harris needs to show up more in the media because she is not
being seen as a ""heavyweight.""
""She's got such a big problem with men"" Mitchell said adding that support for Trump among that
demographic could be underestimated.
She proceeded to blame misogny as one of the reasons Harris wasn't being taken as seriously
among both Republican and Democratic men.

Harris has taken heat for largely avoiding the press. Since becoming the Democratic nominee 72

very young guy with my father?"" Trump told the crowd.
CRITICS DRAG HARRIS FOR 'CRINGE' PRE-RECORDED VIDEO AIRED DURING CATHOLIC
CHARITY DINNER
""It?s an honor to be here to support the city and the community. It?s a great community that I love.
I?ve been here a long time and I love it.""
Since its founding in 1946 the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation has raised millions of dollars to
support nonprofit Catholic organizations in the Archdiocese of New York. Established by Francis
Cardinal Spellman in honor of Catholic New York Gov. Alfred Emanuel Smith the foundation
supports organizations providing education health care services and family resources.
In 2023 a record $7.3 million was raised to help the poor sick and underprivileged in New York.Catholic Charities Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center Sisters of Life and the Inner-City Scholarship
Fund are among the numerous impactful organizations that the Foundation benefits and supports.
Last year because of the Foundation?s help 175 special needs children received assistance at
school more than 400 foster children received mental health treatments 120 children were tutored
weekly and 763 students attended Camp Veritas.
The annual dinner is a cherished opportunity for people with different backgrounds and beliefs to
unite in support of helping those in need. Since 1960 presidential candidates of major parties during
election years have taken a night off to attend the dinner engage in some light-hearted banter and
bring attention to the many worthy causes the foundation supports.
In 1960 Vice President Richard Nixon and Sen. John F. Kennedy were the first presidential
candidates to appear and give remarks at the dinner together emphasizing the impact and legacy of
Al Smith.
As Nixon said ""Al Smith is a man who is bigger than his party ? because the ideals for which he
stood were as big as America itself.""
This is what the Al Smith Dinner is all about ? an evening of cordiality for a common cause that
benefits Americans in need.
Apparently that was too much to ask of Harris.
In a break with precedent Harris declined the invitation to attend the Al Smith Dinner the first
presidential candidate to do so since Walter Mondale in 1984. Instead she sent in a pre-recordedvideo message.
If there was any question about Harris?s priorities consider that her campaign found time for an
appearance on the vulgar ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast but not for a fundraiser benefiting impoverished
children.

With each passing day more Americans are reminded of Harris?s abysmal record targeting
Catholics as California?s attorney general and U.S. senator and as vice president of the United
States.
As attorney general Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court calling on the court to
force family-owned Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception
for its employees.
Recall the vitriol with which Sen. Harris questioned Catholic judicial nominees as a member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris implied that affiliation with the Knights of Columbus ? a Catholic
charitable organization that included JFK among its members ? was grounds for disqualification.
And during her tenure as vice president practicing Catholics have been suspected and accused of
domestic terrorism and violent extremism.

struggles with Black males: 'Coin flip'
Voters in a Detroit barber shop got candid about the 2024 presidential election with many torn
about whom to cast their ballot for as Vice President Kamala Harris struggles to gain ground with
Black males.
""Fox & Friends"" co-host Lawrence Jones spoke with voters at the barber shop to gauge their opinion
on the state of the race as the economy crime and illegal immigration remain top issues just weeks
before Election Day.
CNN DATA REPORTER PREDICTS TRUMP WILL WIN ?HISTORIC? NUMBER OF BLACK AND
HISPANIC VOTERS
""I'm still in between myself. A lot of decisions have to be made"" one voter told Jones. ""Me being an
entrepreneur and a father and a grandfather I'm looking at what state my children will be in ten
years from now.""
""I do think that Trump has some benefits as far as bringing and keeping our jobs right here right
here in this country not sending another job overseas"" he continued. ""We're already going through
enough crises right here in our country and I think the working class we need more job security
right here in this country.""
Some voters argued the race is a complete toss-up as recent polling has indicated Harris and Trump
are neck-and-neck in key battleground states.
""I think it's a coin flip at this time"" one voter said. ""I really do.""""I think the country is so divided you wouldn't have numbers like you have if the country weren't
divided between the two candidates"" another voter said. ""It's pretty much 50/50.""
Meanwhile Harris has tried to woo Black males specifically as her support dwindles within the
demographic.
According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday Harris currently holds 78%
of the Black vote which is down from 2020 when President Biden won approximately 90% of that
voting bloc. It's also down from 2016 when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote.
Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly according to the report: 70%
said they would vote for Harris in November down from Biden?s 85% in 2020.
HERSCHEL WALKER SAYS OBAMA ?FORGOT OUR FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO VOTE? AFTER
SCOLDING BLACK VOTERS AGAINST HARRIS
The vice president dismissed concerns about the dismal polling earlier this week suggesting that
the trend could change in the coming weeks before the November election.
""One that's not my experience"" Harris said during an interview on Black-focused entertainment
outlet ""The Shade Room."" ""Two Election Day has not arrived yet.""
Jones said about half of the voters said they would support Trump and the other half would support
Harris although there were still some that were undecided.
""At the end of the day I'm Trump because... My eyes [are] open"" one voter said. ""I can see that hewas doing a lot better than what we going through right now. You can't even go to the grocery stores
right now without making a life decision or what you want to get? You got to compromise.""
Two voters argued emotion should be taken out of the equation when deciding who to vote for.
""The problem is... We vote emotion. That's not smart"" one voter said. ""We need to vote. We need to
educate ourselves first.""
This comes after former President Barack Obama scolded Black men on the campaign trail bluntly
saying he could not understand why Harris was not enjoying the same level of enthusiasm noting
that the hesitation was ""more pronounced with the brothers.""
HARRIS UNVEILS NEW AGENDA AS SHE COURTS BLACK MALE VOTERS
""You?re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses"" Obama said. ""I?ve got a problem with
that.""
Speaking directly to Black males the former president said that ""part of it makes me think that well
you just aren?t feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you?re coming up with other
alternatives and other reasons for that.""
In a bid to shore up support Harris released her ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men"" this week
which includes providing 1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others to
start a business championing education training and mentorship programs that help Black men get
good-paying jobs in high-demand industries and lead their communities including pathways to
become teachers.Regardless some voters are still torn.
""The presidency is not a person"" one voter told Jones. ""It's an institution that should be protected?
and I think we need to get back to that understanding the position understanding what the intended
job is.""
""It's not Kamala Harris. It's not Joe Biden. It's not Donald Trump"" he continued. ""It's the United

President Joe Biden held the floor for an impromptu Q&A session Friday afternoon during the White

In the president's surprise appearance he remarked on the port strike the latest jobs numbers and
briefly on Hurricane Helene. No reporters asked about the administration's response to the storm
but one asked Biden to assess whether Harris has been deeply involved in policy.
""Well she's I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all we're singing from the same song

past 3 ½ years despite the Harris campaign's attempts to distance her from everything from
""Bidenomics"" to inflation to the border crisis since Biden announced he was ending his reelection
campaign and Harris assumed the mantle of nominee.
Harris recently changed the Biden fiscal year 2025 plan from a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% on a
salary of $1M or more to her own 28% for example. As illegal migration across the border surged to
historic levels Harris has also insisted she was never in charge of Biden's border policy despite
Biden personally handing her the reins at the White House in March 2021.
Axios reported that Harris would begin creating some daylight between herself and Biden in August
in order to defeat Trump as inflation raged wars in Ukraine and the Middle East heated up the
border crisis continued crime lingered as a concern and other factors including Harris' own weak
approval rating weighed her campaign down. Other outlets and pundits on the left soon followed
suit.

years casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy.""

'properly' secured hitting Republicans
Former President Bill Clinton said in a speech Sunday that Georgia nursing student Laken Riley's
murder would not have happened if the alleged killer an illegal immigrant was properly vetted.
While campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris in the Peach State Clinton accused her rival
former President Trump of tanking negotiations over a bipartisan border compromise in Congress
because he wanted it to be a campaign issue.
He seemed to suggest that Riley's death could have been avoided if Congress was able to pass a
compromise ? despite the alleged killer having already been vetted.
""She's the only candidate who has actually endorsed a bill that would hold down immigration any
given year to a certain point and then made sure we gave people a decent place to live didn't divide
people from their children. And we did total vetting before people got in. Now Trump killed the bill""
Clinton said.
GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO
WIN BACK PEACH STATE
""You had a case in Georgia not very long ago didn't you? They made an ad about it a young
woman who had been killed by an immigrant. Yeah well if they'd all been properly vetted that
probably wouldn't have happened.""
""And America isn't having enough babies to keep our populations up so we need immigrants that
have been vetted to do work ? there wouldn't be a problem"" he added.Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) meanwhile previously publicly confirmed that people who are
encountered trying to cross the border illegally are vetted and screened.
The alleged killer was encountered by CBP on Sept. 8 2022 after entering near El Paso Texas
and was ""paroled and released for further processing."" Fox News Digital was previously told.
The bipartisan border deal also only failed earlier this year years after the Venezuelan national
accused of killing Riley entered the country still under the Biden administration's watch.
Clinton later praised the current administration?s handling of the border and illegal immigration
during a campaign stop in Georgia on Monday.
""For the last three years the Biden-Harris administration has done increasingly tough things trying
to control the border. And illegal crossings have gone down every year for three years. Our friends
in the other party don't want to talk about that"" Clinton said.
TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT
SECOND DEBATE
It is notable that the former president?s speech largely focused on the border in Georgia a state
President Biden won by less than 1% in 2020.
The issue of illegal crossings at the border has become a political lightening rod in this election
cycle. Democrats in tight races ? both for the presidency and congressional and local positions ? are
emphasizing their support for tougher border security measures as Americans across the countryhave seen their area infrastructures strained by a deluge of people seeking shelter in the U.S.
However Republicans have long criticized Democrats? handling of border security citing the record
number of border crossings since Biden took office. They have continued to do so during the
campaign by arguing Harris has failed to live up to her informal ""border czar"" title.
Despite several instances of high-profile use in the media Clinton accused Republicans of
bestowing the title on Harris ? which he dismissed as inaccurate.
""They want to attack Kamala Harris and blame her for anything they managed to keep from
happening. Like they claim she was the ?border czar? that's not what her jobs are"" Clinton said.
""Her job was to go down to these other countries that were sending us a lot of people and trying to
get them to enroll them in a legal process while they were still in the country so they wouldn't be
illegally trafficked show up our border had to be cared for on one side of it or another and then
we'd run the risk of having people get in here who weren't properly vetted. That's what she tried to
do.""

together. The nature of the evening is civility patriotism humor. It's not a campaign speech. It's not
a campaign stop.""
Trump is expected to attend the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner on Thursday while
Harris is campaigning in Wisconsin as the Democratic presidential nominee turns her focus to the
""blue wall"" states which Hillary Clinton neglected in the final weeks of her failed 2016 campaign.

Dolan argued the dinner is ""worth keeping worth doing"" given it could raise $9 million for charity.
""We're upset that she didn't come because we've missed an evening to access something sorely
needed now that even she articulates rather eloquently: that we've got to turn the page on

that.""

wants to maximize her time in the battlegrounds this close to the election"" the Harris campaign told
Fox News explaining her absence. ""Her team also told the organizers that she would very much like

winning the election after making so many boasts about strongman policies would give the former
president more legitimacy to carry them out.
""If he wins he?s gonna say ?I told people I was going to do this. I have the legitimacy of an election

networks likening Trump to Hitler
CNN anchor John Berman and Rep. Mike Waltz R-Fla. got into a tense exchange Tuesday
morning over politically charged terms like ""fascist"" and ""socialist"" that have been used to describe
the two presidential candidates.
At a recent rally in Erie Pennsylvania Vice President Kamala Harris played a mashup of clips in
which Trump warned of dangers from ""the enemy within.""
""The worst people are the enemies from within... those people are more dangerous; the enemy
within; than Russia and China. These people should be put in jail the way they talk about our judges
and our justices"" Trump collectively stated in some of the television clips played.
In recent comments on the matter to Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo Trump spoke about such
""enemies"" and quipped that while China and Russia are ""dangerous"" at times to deal with ""the
thing that's tougher to handle are these lunatics that we have inside like Adam Schiff.""
MAHER SAYS HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT 'CRAZY' TRUMP WINNING ELECTION: ?NOT
EVEN NERVOUS'
Schiff a congressman from Burbank Calif. is currently the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate
against Republican retired MLB star Steve Garvey.
During an interview on ""CNN News Central"" Berman asked Waltz whether it was ""responsible"" for
Trump to make such comments.Waltz claimed that Trump was talking about issues that are ""detrimental"" to democracy in the United
States and undermine public trust in institutions. For example he claimed that Schiff a senior
House Intelligence Committee member leaked information from compartmented hearings and lied
to the public in open hearings.
Berman then referenced the ""lunatic"" comment directed at Schiff and suggested that Trump was
also talking about dealing with ""lunatics"" in a hypothetical military deployment.
""John people were on this network calling Trump Hitler and the next coming of another dictator and
two people have tried to kill him. We have the Iranians trying to kill him. A foreign adversary trying to
assassinate him and we're talking about him playing music in a rally"" Waltz said.
Berman acknowledged that while it is essential to talk about heated rhetoric directed at Trump
Waltz himself has suggested that Harris is a ""socialist.""
AS A CAUTIOUS KAMALA LOSES MOMENTUM DEMOCRATS ARE PANICKING OVER A
TRUMP WIN
""So these phrases do get tossed around"" Berman added.
Waltz said that socialism is a ""longstanding political ideology"" and very different from claiming that
Trump would be ""the world's most god-awful dictator"" and Hitler. Waltz also contended that such
language is radicalizing people to take action.
He also noted that some members of Congress have referred to themselves as ""democratic
socialists"" and insisted that Berman was not making a ""fair comparison.""""You don't?"" Berman asked. ""You talk about Marxism. You talk about socialism. And do you think
Kamala Harris is a Marxist or a socialist?""

realize he's a total fascist. He is the most dangerous person to this country"" according to a new

more popular than in past elections
CNN polling expert said Friday that while former President Trump is less popular than his opponent
he is more popular at this stage of the race than he was when he went on to win the 2016 election.
Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump have been running an extremely tight race in recent
weeks and both candidates have been on a media blitz ranging from podcasts to town hall
appearances.
CNN senior political data reporter Harry Enten highlighted that one key disparity shows the Harris
honeymoon momentum may be over while Trump is on the rise.
""I think that there are a lot of folks like myself who think that Trump?s unpopularity is baked in but
here?s the deal"" the network?s data guru said. ""If you believe that Donald Trump has somehow
become less popular over time let me change your mind about that. In fact he is more popular at
this point in the campaign than he was in the 2020 campaign or the 2016 campaign.""
Enten conceded that Trump is ultimately ""still underwater"" with a net favorability rating of -9 points
but the fact that it is higher than in 2020 and far higher than 2016 should raise a clear concern for
Harris? campaign.

""So I think there?s this real question in Kamala Harris? mind in the campaign?s mind ?Why is
Trump more popular now than he was in 2020 or 2016??"" he asked before saying such numbersare ""why you?re seeing the sharpening attacks"" from the Harris campaign.
""Kamala Harris is more popular than Donald Trump but Kamala Harris had her popularity rising
once of course she became the presumptive Democratic nominee"" he recalled. ""But she has fallen

popular than Trump much more and barely won and Hillary Clinton was more popular than Donald

CNN data reporter Harry Enten warned on Sunday that former President Trump is predicted to win a
""historic"" number of Black and Hispanic voters in the November election.
During an appearance on ""Inside Politics"" Enten revealed the potentially bad news for Democrats
and also noted that Republicans are outpacing Democrats in party identification and registration for
the first time in almost 40 years.
""At this particular hour if you believe the polling Donald Trump?s going to put up the best
performance with Black voters since Richard Nixon in the 1960s"" Enten said.
A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Sunday suggested that Vice President Kamala
Harris holds 78% percent of the Black vote. Hillary Clinton won the voting block with 92% in 2016
and President Biden won approximately 90% in 2020.

'COULD NOT BE CLOSER'
Enten also told a CNN panel on Sunday that Trump is expected to put up the ""best performance"" for
a Republican when it comes to Hispanic voters since former President George W. Bush in 2004.
""The GOP leads by a point in party identification right now"" he said. ""The average when the
Republican Party loses is the Democrats ahead by 8. When the Republican Party wins the average
party ID advantage for Democrats is 3. Republicans right now Manu are doing even better than the
average when they win"" Enten added.He noted that the party registration and party ID data ""points in a good direction"" for Trump.
However Enten questioned whether Trump?s performance among minority groups could be erased
by Harris? support among college-educated White voters.

SURPRISING GROUP
""The question ultimately is?is that enough to offset the strength that Kamala Harris has with White
voters with a college degree? At this particular moment she has the strongest margin with them
than any Democrat going back since recorded history with polling I guess since 1948 1952
wherever you want to put it"" he said.
Enten calculated that Harris is winning the demographic by 18 points.

""Sometimes there are data points that just jump off the screen should set off sirens. Alright this is
union households. This is the Democratic margin in the presidential election. It ain?t what it used to
be"" Enten began. ""Bill Clinton won that union vote by 30 points. Hillary Clinton only won it by 12
points back in 2016. That was the lowest mark for a Democrat since 1984 Mondale vs. Reagan. But

President Biden according to Enten was at +19 among union household voters in November 2020.

""Look at this margin this to me oh boy does this tell you about the state of our politics now vs. back
in the early 1990s margin among vocational and trade school grads in pre-election polling. Bill
Clinton was leading that vote over George H.W. Bush by seven points. Look at where Donald Trump
is today over Kamala Harris a 31-point advantage"" Enten said.The Teamsters labor union announced recently that they would not be endorsing a presidential
candidate. The labor union has endorsed Democratic candidates in almost every election since
1988 when they endorsed George H.W. Bush. The union also chose not to endorse a candidate in
the 1996 election.
""When I think people think of the working class they think of people who use their hands. And we
know that Donald Trump has been going after that vote and he is in a very very strong position
more so perhaps than any other bloc. The folks who go to trade school vocational school that has
moved from being a core Democratic group to now being a core group of Donald Trump?s massive

25,Conservative,FOX News,"DAVID MARCUS: 5 reasons Kamala Harris is snubbing the Al Smith
Dinner Catholics and tradition
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
Vice President Kamala Harris has announced that she will not be attending this year?s Al Smith
Dinner making her the first presidential candidate since Walter Mondale in 1984 to snub New York
City?s famous Catholic event.
The tradition began in 1960 with John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon donning their high hats white
spats and Arrow collars and ever since it has been an evening of national and political unity.
KAMALA HARRIS TO SKIP HISTORIC AL SMITH DINNER DESPITE LONG-STANDING
TRADITION
Gotham?s Cardinal Timothy Dolan called Harris? decision ""disappointing"" reminding the veep that
Walter Mondale lost all but his home state when he RSVP?d in the negative way back in 1984 and
even some liberal pundits are scratching their heads at the decision.
After all the Al Smith dinner is a venerated institution because it is a rare moment in today?s politics
when candidates poke gentle fun at each other and enjoy dinner together showing the country that
there is more that unites us than divides us.
In fact Harris has at least five very good reasons for ducking this showcase of togetherness and
each is deeply cynical. But taken together they explain exactly why she is turning her back on
tradition and potentially alienating Catholic voters.1. Harris Does Not Want To Humanize Trump
The vice president is running a bizarre and unprecedented campaign in which she insists she no
longer holds the positions she did three years ago and doesn?t feel much need to let us all know
what the new positions are. This leaves one strategy for her and that is to paint Donald Trump as a
fascist would-be dictator who would destroy democracy a day after being sworn in using a copy of
Project 2025.
Having a wonderful dinner under the auspices of His Eminence the smiling and congenial Cardinal
Dolan really doesn?t send that message. In fact it sends exactly the opposite message. And if
Trump isn?t actually evil incarnate then people might suddenly start comparing economic policies
and the Democrats can?t have that.
2. The Al Smith Dinner Is Too Unscripted For Harris
It?s no secret that the Harris campaign has been closeting their candidate away from unscripted
events whenever possible. Medieval monks weren?t this cloistered. In order to participate in the
dinner Harris would have to appear on the dais without a teleprompter in front of a crowd that
wasn?t hand-chosen and deliver 5-10 minutes of comic material. Nothing we have ever seen Harris
do even remotely suggests she is capable of this and her handlers may know all too well that she
isn?t.
3. Protesting The Church Is A Wink At The Far Left
The Harris campaign has settled into an approach in which it vaguely moves to the center by
disavowing her past as the most liberal member of the Senate while also winking at progressives tolet them know she really doesn?t mean it. Snubbing the most important Catholic event on the
political calendar sends exactly that message to her far-left supporters. Sure she has to say certain
things to get elected but she is really all about sticking it to the oppressors and what represents
that better than insulting the Catholic Church?
4. Harris Does Not Want A Level Playing Field
As we have seen with the Harris campaign hand selecting only left-leaning networks for proposed
debates against Trump and declining the one on Fox News that had been scheduled with President
Joe Biden Kamala is not willing to face Trump on equal terms. Without an edge without wildly
biased debate moderators there is no reason to believe Harris can go toe to toe with anyone much
less Donald Trump. She was not battle tested in a primary and wants no part of a fair fight.
5. Kamala Harris Isn?t Funny
The main goal of anyone delivering remarks at the Al Smith dinner is to score some laughs and with
decent enough joke writers most politicians can manage it but can Kamala Harris? While it's true
that many of her incomprehensible word salads are unintentionally funny when she actually tries to
be amusing she generally starts cackling at her own joke while saying ""right? right?? to a confused
and distinctly not laughing audience. This is just one more aspect of the vice president that the
Hidin? Harris campaign wants to keep under wraps.

Traditions matter to societiesc. So does the ability even in the midst of the most heated political
times to put all that aside and remember that we are all human beings first. But sadly those kindsof old-timey ideals do not fit with Harris? agenda.
Harris not only wants us to dislike each other based on our politics she needs us to because if
Trump is a human being if he is a decent fun person who simply has different political opinions
then Harris has no case to make. So tradition the church and basic comity be damned.",FOX News_DAVID_MARCUS_5_reasons_Kamala_Harris_is_snubbing_t.pdf.pdf,news_articles

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
In every election there are moments some obvious at the time some less so that shape the state
of the race leaving public opinion on the ground and eventually in the polls very different from how
they found it.
This year is no exception and since the contest hit the final stretch under early September skies
there are five events -- twists in the road -- that have led to the general sense of panic we see
among Democrats and renewed confidence for the Republicans.
IF 2024 POLLING ERRORS MIRROR THOSE IN 2020 ELECTION TRUMP ?WINS IN A
BLOWOUT? SAYS CNN DATA GURU
It is worth remembering that at the end of August Kamala Harris was firmly leading Donald Trump
was being bashed even by some on the right for choosing JD Vance as his running mate and
frankly the picture was looking really rosy for the Democrats. But that was all about to change.
Here are the five moments that wrought that change.
1. RFK Jr Endorsing (And Normalizing) Trump
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?s endorsement of Donald Trump at the end of August was the moment that
Trump regained momentum in the election. Harris had flatlined albeit with a narrow lead but the
Trump campaign was also stalled out.RFK Jr did two things. First he brought along most of his voters as polls now show us to Trump
and these are people who aren?t big fans of Trump or Harris but trust the Kennedy scion to
demand accountability from either. Second the endorsement was an arrow to the heart of the
argument that Trump is some fascist or threat to democracy. If Kennedy wasn?t buying it then
neither were most Americans in the middle.
2. The Harris Debate Victory Mirage
In the minutes after last month?s debate between Harris and Trump Democrats and their media
allies were over the moon about Kamala speaking her truth to power and stylistically trouncing the
bad orange man.
Others weren?t so sure. Yes Trump seemed flat and Harris did better than many expected but she
had a unique job to do which was to tell the American people who she is and what she stands for
especially given that she had no primary cycle in which to do so. On this count she squarely failed
and the voters I spoke to all knew it. It was the biggest missed opportunity of the race by either side.
There was no bounce for Harris. In fact it was when polls started moving to Trump.
3. JD Vance Strikes Back
As I have insisted in these pages for months the media?s farcical attack on JD Vance for being
weird never landed with voters but it was enough early on to be a stumbling block leading the
punditry to declare his selection a mistake. Then he debated Democratic Vice Presidential Nominee
Tim Walz coming away with a clear if not overwhelming victory.
Before and after the debate Vance sought out every tough interview he could get and provedhimself deft and able at defending Trump and populism even in the teeth of left-wing talking points.
Today it is obvious that his selection was a boon to the ticket.
4. Joe Biden Voters Jumping Ship
Of all the hard turns and switchbacks of the past month the one that nobody I talked to saw coming
be they voters pundits consultants or clairvoyants was that there a significant number of voters
especially in Pennsylvania who would have voted for Scranton Joe but aren?t voting for Harris.
The bombshell moment that revealed this was the Teamsters refusal to endorse Kamala after the
union?s internal polling showed that while Biden beat Trump Trump trounced Harris among its
members. According to Pew Research Trump now has the lead in the bellwether Catholic vote
which Biden won in 2020. This as Harris refuses to attend the Catholic Al Smith Dinner and Gov
Gretchen Whitmer mocks the Eucharist on tik tok with a Harris Walz hat on.
This could all spell revenge for Joseph Robinette Biden.

TV. It did not go well.
First she did so poorly on ""60 Minutes"" that CBS News had to surreptitiously edit her real responseto a question about Israel when her ham-fisted actual response was a rank slurry of jingoistic
buzzwords.

class could sway the election: Report
Democrats are privately worried about Vice President Kamala Harris? ability to shore up votes
among White working-class voters ? an important demographic to securing victory in the November
election.
According to a new report from Politico while members of the Democratic Party are publicly
expressing confidence behind closed doors officials and allies fear that former President Donald
Trump could shatter the Blue Wall he broke down eight years ago.
""Candidly Trump has a solid solid base of working-class people that have bought into his
message"" Jimmy Williams president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades told
Politico.
""It?s movable and it?s been moving. But it?s not like some tide that?s turned"" he said.
KAMALA HARRIS HIT FOR BEING VAGUE DODGING QUESTIONS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS:
'SHE OWES US THESE ANSWERS'
The fresh concern comes as the Teamsters labor union chose to withhold an endorsement from
Harris last week following internal polling that showed higher favorability for Trump among
respondents.
Democrats told Politico that Trump may garner unexpectedly high support among union members ?
especially men. They also say Harris must work harder to win over the White working-class voting
bloc which comprises a large percentage of the Rust Belt electorate.One pro-Harris union official who Politico granted anonymity said the polling was a ""red flag"" for
Democrats and was reminiscent of 2016 when Hillary Clinton underperformed among union
households.
""Hard not to have HRC flashbacks right now to be honest that stuff might be wrong beneath the
surface"" the official said. ""I hope it?s not.""
Swing-state Democrats also claimed that Harris is not criticizing Trump enough on past comments
he has made regarding issues that matter to older voters such as Social Security and Medicare.

having flashbacks to 2016'
Democrats are worried about the state of the 2024 presidential race and fear the election could be a
repeat of 2016 according to a new report.
Sources close to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign reportedly told CNN that Democrats were
panicked because polls have largely remained stagnant with less than four weeks to go until the
election.
""People are nervous. They know the polls are tight"" one source told CNN. ""A lot of us are having
these flashbacks to 2016 too. We know when it can go the wrong way and it can still feel fresh.""

with Democratic insiders close to the Harris campaign who are worried that the race remains
deadlocked despite the campaign's efforts to reach more voters.

ME? THEY BELIEVE TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN
""This has been a campaign that was described by multiple Democrats allies aides to the vice
president as a good vibes campaign. But what?s also creeping in now is that anxiety"" Alvarez
explained. ""The reason for that is because these polls are not really moving. Despite multiple
battleground blitzes despite the opportunities she has had across media outlets there is still not a
lot of movement from voters who are moving more towards her versus former President Donald
Trump.""The Harris campaign is trying to address pitfalls from Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign in its outreach
to red rural districts that Clinton lost in that election like Cambria County Pennsylvania Alvarez
explained.
""The vice president has already visited twice. And so that is the type of strategy that they?re trying
to deploy to try to make up that ground where they saw Hillary Clinton wasn?t able to in 2016. Then
too there?s the mobilizing. Talking to Democrats they?re always pretty boastful about their ground
game and they continue to be so but that needs to turn into votes. So certainly some anxiety and
nerves setting in as Election Day gets closer and those polls just remain deadlocked"" she
continued.

""Everything is deadlocked and the composition of the electorate is unknowable and there are so
many things that are unprecedented"" Simmons who formerly served as Harris' communications
director said.
""We can?t look back with any level of security because we haven?t had an African American woman

30,Conservative,FOX News,"Dem incumbent spars with GOP challenger in final debate for race
that could decide House balance of power
CINCINNATI ? The third and final debate in one of the most closely watched House races in the
country took place in southwest Ohio on Tuesday night where Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman and
his GOP challenger Orlando Sonza squared off on a variety of issues from immigration to the
economy to a newly surfaced ethics complaint.
""As I walk around this district now whether it's the economy or followed very closely by the issue
with the southern border immigration those are at the forefront of voters minds"" Sonza told the
crowd of mostly students at Xavier University in Cincinnati as he debated Landsman in the race for
Ohio?s 1st Congressional District.
""My dad had to wait five years to be a naturalized citizen"" Sonza continued. ""So what we're seeing
in this country right now flies in the face of not just my dad but the millions of Americans that have
come in here illegally. So how do we actually stop the over 15 million illegal immigrants that have
come into our country that are overburdening our economy overburdening our housing market and
also bringing in fentanyl like endemic here in southwest Ohio rising crime.""
""Well you've got to immediately close that border and I know that look if I was in Congress in these
last 20 months I would have voted for the Secure Border Act unlike my opponent that would have
immediately secured the southern border brought resources to our border Patrol and also
tightened up our asylum policies and actually sent resources to our immigration courts. So in both of
those ways you can bring in people here legally and welcome them in here just like my family did to
pursue the American dream. But we have to do it in a way that actually stops the bleeding at the
southern border and actually tightens the policies and procedures that we have.""OHIO LT. GOV. ENCOURAGES SUPPORT FOR TRUMP?S ?SWAMP THE VOTE? STRATEGY
AS KEY STATE'S EARLY VOTING OPENS
Landsman responded to the immigration question by suggesting that he sees ""eye to eye"" with
Sonza on many aspects of the problem.
""The fact is that you have to have a secure border and for far too long both parties have messed
this up"" Landsman said echoing the argument from many Democrats that the failed bipartisan
border bill over the summer would have made a difference at the border.
""That was a good bill that will get 300 votes in the House probably 80 90 in the Senate"" Landsman
said. ""It was a bill put together by one of the most conservative Republicans in the United States
Senate and it would have come to us but for Trump. Trump did not want it to get in the way of his
reelection campaign.""
On the economy the issue that polling shows most Americans list as their top concern Landsman
took issue with billionaires receiving tax breaks while others struggle to make ends meet.
""I think more and more Americans even though the economy has gotten better more and more
Americans are finding it harder and harder to pay all their bills or if they pay all their bills there's
almost nothing left for savings or vacation and so the question becomes who's the economy built
for?"" Landsman said taking aim at former President Trump?s tax policy.
OHIO GOP SENATE CHALLENGER REACTS TO POLLS SHOWING DEAD HEAT IN CRITICAL
SENATE RACE: 'RADICAL LIBERAL'""You can look at the results that those at the top the 1% the super wealthy they're doing great""
Landsman said. ""This is the best it's ever been for billionaires and big corporations. And that's in
part because the tax code is built for them. Eighty-three percent of the tax giveaways in the 2017
Trump tax plan went to the top 1%. But what if you flipped it? What if you said that 83 to 90 percent
of all of that will go to the working folks and middle-class families you all like? You have a much
better economy because you'd have more money in your pockets to buy goods and services here in
our local communities. And that creates jobs as opposed to what happens when the one percent get
more money.""
Landsman said that ""fixing the tax code is number one"" and ""number two is that you're going to have
to deal with price gouging.""
Sonza discussed the economy by pointing out that his family of four is dealing with the high costs of
goods.
""So what's the first problem?"" Sonza said. ""It is this hyperinflationary environment that we have.
How do you fix prices that continue to increase due to this inflation? What you have to do is you
have to stop this idea of spend spend spend in our federal government.""
Sonza a West Point graduate and former infantry officer continued ""You can start with cutting the
fraud waste and abuse and the duplication and the redundancy in government. So stopping this
over-bloated government spending fixes the inflation problem. But what do you then do with prices
still high? Well what you can't do is make sure that we have a competitive environment that allows
for prices to go down.""
""So we actually increase competition whether it's in health care or whether it's in manufacturing orenergy. If we increase competition here in America we're actually going to bring those prices down.
I think that's how you fix both of those problems.""
FLASHBACK: VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR ACCUSED VOTERS SUPPORTING TRUMP OF
'RACISM': 'IT WORKS FOR THEM'
On abortion Sonza told the audience he does not ""hide"" the fact that he is pro-life but pledged that
he would not support a federal abortion ban and believes in exceptions for life of the mother rape
and incest. Sonza said abortion is no longer a federal issue and acknowledged that Ohio voters
recently chose to enshrine abortion access into the state Constitution.
Sonza argued that Landman?s opposition to the Born Alive Act which instructs doctors to attempt to
save the life of a newborn who survives an abortion shows that Democrats have adopted ""extreme""
positions on abortion that most Americans disagree with.
Landsman expressed his support for codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law.
""It's not the role of politicians to be telling you what you can and can't do with your healthcare and
politicians whether it's at the federal level at the state level are getting in the middle of these very
complicated medical decisions"" Landsman said. ""It's not only dangerous but it has gotten people
killed. There are women who have lost their lives because of these new laws. These bans are bad.
They're bad for women. They're bad for doctors and bad for our daughters. They're bad for our
economies. They're bad for the country and this is a big difference. I will restore reproductive
freedom.""
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOne of the more contentious exchanges occurred after Sonza brought up a recent ethics complaint
against Landsman by a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Commerce accusing him
of breaking the law by waiting 20 months to disclose stock transactions far outside the mandatory
45-day period.
""It was my opponent that violated Federal Stock Act in failing to disclose over 80 stock transactions
within the 45-day timeline"" Sonza said. ""How long did it take Congressman Landsman to disclose
over 80 stock transactions? 20 months. That to me is not a mistake. That's a pattern of misconduct
that I believe is a threat to democracy and I think we have the ability to hold our elected officials
accountable.""
""It was a question of whether or not the stock trades were disclosed"" Landsman said. ""They've all
been disclosed. I have nothing to do with my trades. And so I didn't know. Once I found out when we
were putting our financial disclosure together we disclosed them. It was late and that was wrong.
And I took responsibility. It happened to maybe 60 70 80 members of Congress in the last term
dozens this term. And we put in place a system to make sure it doesn't happen again.""
Sonza pressed the issue again later in the debate.
""Those of you here those of you at home are learning not 20 months prior but 20 months later that
the sitting congressman who sits on the Small Business Committee in Congress fails to disclose
over 80 stock transactions some of them in the very corporations that he railed against his
opponent in 2022 Big Pharma and Big Oil.""
""Forty-six days a mistake 48 days a slip up 20 months to fail to disclose that and the reasoningwe get on this stage is because I don't do my stock transactions?"" Sonza added. ""That's not the way
my wife and I train our kids on how to actually save the money. You are responsible for every dollar
that goes into your piggy bank.""
The Cook Political Report ranks the 1st District race as ""likely Democrat"" but Republicans have
dedicated resources to the race as they look to protect their slim majority in the House. Landsman
won by just over five points in 2022.

Some of the criticism from Democratic strategists also included suggestions the Harris campaign get
more aggressive.
""They need to be sharp. They need to be aggressive. They need to stop answering questions and
start asking questions"" Carville insisted on Wednesday. ""I think she and the whole campaign need
to be much more aggressive and much less passive than they are.""
""In these campaigns every time you clear a bar the bar gets raised"" added Axelrod. ""You have to
lift your game and adjust your strategy.""

from past presidential cycles and among Black men in particular.
""When you hear those numbers and you're seeing in the polls ? Black men aren't as excited or fired

Vote-by-mail data in three key states shows the edge Democrats enjoyed in 2020 has plummeted
something one expert said is a great sign for Republicans and former President Donald Trump.
""It?s great news that Republicans are starting to early vote"" Jimmy Keady the founder and
president of JLK Political Strategies a Republican consulting firm told Fox News Digital.
The comments come as the Democratic edge in vote-by-mail requests has shrunk significantly in
Florida North Carolina and Pennsylvania according to data by Decision Desk HQ signaling a shift
in voter habits that have defined the last two elections.
FIRST ON FOX: HARRIS AIMS TO TROLL TRUMP - AGAIN - OVER CROWD SIZES
According to the data the Democratic lead in vote-by-mail requests has shrunk by over 5% in
Florida nearly 15% in North Carolina and over 35% in Pennsylvania.
Getting voters out to early in-person voting or to vote by mail can free up resources for campaigns
Keady said allowing them to focus their attention on lower propensity voters who often play a big
role in deciding elections.
""I?m sure voters complain all the time about text messages about getting mail about getting
robocalls to go vote"" Keady said. ""Campaigns are now sophisticated enough that once you go vote
those stop? once a voter goes to vote and those stop that allows resource allocation from that
voter to another voter.""
Getting those lower propensity voters out could play a huge role in states like Pennsylvania andNorth Carolina which are both expected to once again be swing states with razor-tight margins.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SHOW
Vice President Kamala Harris holds a lead of less than a point in Pennsylvania while Trump holds a
similarly sized lead in North Carolina according to the Real Clear Politics polling average meaning
the ground game to turn out voters on each side could be the deciding factor in the election.
The Democratic advantage in mail-in and early voting very well might have been the difference in
the 2020 election but Keady sees shifting momentum for the GOP on that front in 2024.
""It definitely signals that A there?s turnout? but B also that the base has adopted kind of being
able to accept that early voting is a proper and mostly secure way to vote"" Keady said.

declare that the state board lacks the authority to force it ""to accept and Fulton County to pay for
additional monitors for the 2024 election that have been hand-picked by certain State Election Board
members.""
""The State Election Board has no statutory authority to force the Fulton County BRE [Board of

code. It voted to issue a letter of reprimand which included instructions for an agreement on a
mutually acceptable monitor to be entered into by the board?s August meeting.
However the county and state election boards have been unable to reach an agreement. Thecounty favors a team it has already approved that was proposed by Ryan Germany a former chief
lawyer for the secretary of state?s office and the Atlanta-based Carter Center. The Trump-endorsed
majority on the State Election Board has proposed an alternative slate that includes people who
questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election.
An Aug. 19 legal opinion written by state Attorney General Chris Carr and obtained by The
Associated Press says final decisions of the State Election Board are ""preclusive"" and that
""re-litigation of all claims which have already been adjudicated or which could have been
adjudicated is therefore prohibited."" Fulton County attorneys assert that the approval of the motion
at the May meeting and resulting reprimand meant the case is closed and cannot be reopened and

counts are the same. If a scanner has more than 750 ballots inside at the end of voting the poll
manager can decide to begin the count the following day.

'would make us all less safe'
Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon and Cook County States Attorney Kim Foxx
were among a group of prosecutors who endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president on
Wednesday.
Gascon and Foxx are among the most divisive prosecutors in the country and they argued in a
Wednesday letter alongside dozens of other prosecutors that former President Donald Trump would
make the country ""less safe.""
""Donald Trump would make us all less safe. As president he oversaw the largest murder spike in
history tried to cut funding for law enforcement and boasted that he 'did nothing' on gun violence. If
reelected he would threaten to roll back common sense gun safety laws and lead the charge to
defund federal law enforcement.""
""The choice in this election is clear. While Vice President Harris has spent her career holding
perpetrators accountable Trump has been convicted of fraud and found liable for sexual abuse.
Vice President Harris will keep our communities safe while Donald Trump will put us in danger.
Ultimately America must choose between a prosecutor who cares about public safety and a
convicted felon who only cares about himself. We choose the prosecutor"" the statement continued.

?YOU?VE PULLED OVER THE WRONG PERSON'
Foxx's endorsement comes just days after her office declined to pursue any charges against a
""dangerous"" Colombian migrant who was arrested for murder last week in Chicago.A Chicago Police Department source shared with Fox News the migrant?s illegally-acquired gun
went off in an apartment building killing a ""beautiful and promising"" 17-year-old girl.
The source added that when 19-year-old Juan David Ramirez-Olivo was arrested for murder last
week and questioned by CPD he lied about being from Venezuela. Ramirez-Olivo is a Colombian
national.

The Chicago Police pushed for Olivo to be charged with involuntary manslaughter; Foxx?s office
went to bond court last Friday afternoon and repealed the charges citing ""insufficient evidence"" to
Fox News.
Meanwhile Gascon is facing a lawsuit from the union representing the prosecutors who work in his
office. The Association of Deputy District Attorneys has sued Gascon multiple times in this instance
for withholding information on a close ally in alleged violation of the California Public Records Act
(CPRA).

Prosecutors sought her emails and information about whether she remained on the county payrollafter her indictment. They also wanted to know if county taxpayers were on the hook for her criminal

37,Conservative,FOX News,"FLASHBACK: VP Harris pushed for illegal immigrant to practice law
in California over Obama admin's objections
FLASHBACK: VP Kamala Harris while serving as California?s attorney general sided with an illegal
immigrant?s bid to acquire a license to practice law in a move that was opposed by the Obama
administration.
Harris who is expected to be making a visit to the southern border this week supported in a 2012
Supreme Court brief the desire for 35-year-old illegal immigrant Sergio Garcia to be granted a law
degree by the State Bar of California arguing that the government could not block him from doing
so.
""No law or policy prevents this court from admitting Garcia to the State Bar"" Harris? office wrote in
the brief. ""In fact admitting Garcia to the Bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that
encourages immigrants both documented and undocumented to contribute to society.""
Harris? stance on the issue put her at odds with then-president Barack Obama whose Department
of Justice opposed the move and said it would violate 1996 federal immigration law San Jose
Mercury News reported.
VIDEO RESURFACES OF HARRIS CHANTING ?DOWN WITH DEPORTATION? AT 2018
PARADE WITH DISGRACED ACTOR
""In the view of the United States (federal law) prohibits this court from issuing a law license to an
unlawfully present alien"" government lawyers wrote at the time.
The state bar civil rights groups and Latino lawmakers in the state all came out in support of Garciathe report notes though Harris? endorsement ""made the difference"" Kevin Johnson the dean of
UC Davis? law school told the Sacramento Bee earlier this year.
HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN
PROMISES ?PRAGMATIC? APPROACH
""When the highest law enforcement officer of a state weighs in and says this is legal this is
permissible this is possible the Supreme Court of the State of California listens"" said Johnson
who also represented the State Bar of California in support of Garcia's case. ""She could have
ducked and covered and tried to avoid any political controversy. But she sided with the State Bar of
California and Sergio Garcia so I respect her for that.""
Garcia ultimately became the first undocumented immigrant to practice law in California after the
state Supreme Court sided with him and legislation was passed that allowed the licensing of
individuals regardless of immigration status.
Garcia was ultimately awarded the Medal of Valor by AG Harris before becoming a citizen and
voting for Harris on the presidential ticket along with Joe Biden in 2020 CBS News reported.
MIGRANT CRIME CRISIS COMES TO NANTUCKET MARTHA'S VINEYARD PLAYGROUNDS
FOR RICH AND FAMOUS
The Garcia situation was one of several examples where Harris was to the left of the Obama
administration which Harris referenced during the 2019 presidential primary when she spoke out
against deportations for illegal immigrants who haven't committed any crimes beyond crossing the
border.""Well thank you. I will say ? no absolutely not they should not be deported"" Harris said. ""And I
actually ? this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration with
whom I always had a great relationship and a great deal of respect.""
""But on the secure communities issue I was attorney general of California"" Harris continued. ""I led
the second-largest Department of Justice in the United States second only to the United States
Department of Justice in a state of 40 million people.""
""And on this issue I disagreed with my president because the policy was to allow deportation of
people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals. So as attorney general and the chief law
officer of the state of California I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have
to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interests of public
safety of their community.""
Harris reiterated her differences with Obama on illegal immigration in 2019 interview with Univision's
Jorge Ramos where she said that Obama was ""wrong"" when it came to deportations and ICE
detainers.

dismiss the possible trip as a ""political stunt.""The latest Scripps News/Ipsos Poll  released last week shows that approximately 54% of all
respondents ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" support the idea of mass deportation according to the poll.

Harris was mocked by conservatives Sunday for offering a lengthy ""word salad"" when she was

healthcare benefits for illegal immigrants
FIRST ON FOX: Former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is warning that any push by a Harris
administration to enact ""Medicare-for-all"" would result in more than 12 million illegal immigrants
being added to the program which he says would impact Americans who have paid into it and
invite more illegal immigrants to the U.S.
""It would make the program even more expensive. It would make it harder for us to see doctors. It
would add $2 trillion of spending. It would lead to huge provider cuts. This would have devastating
impact on our seniors"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""And in the middle of all this
Kamala Harris wants to add 12 million illegal immigrants.""
Jindal with the America First Policy Institute is launching a video warning about the five biggest
dangers of ""Medicare-for-all"" which has been a policy goal of left-wing Democrats for years.
TRUMP SOUNDS ALARM ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MURDERERS: ?A LOT OF BAD GENES IN
OUR COUNTRY?
Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly called for the passage of ""Medicare-for-all."" She was a
co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders' legislation and voiced her support for it on multiple occasions.
During her 2019 presidential primary campaign she called for a transition to a ""Medicare-for-all""
type of system.
""So the bottom line and the most important is that everyone have access to health care"" Harris
said. ""That is the goal. That is the purpose for me supporting the policy of ?Medicare-for-all'"" she
said in 2019.She has also said it would include those in the country illegally.
""I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public
safety public education or public health. Period"" she said .
However this year her campaign told media outlets including Fox News that she no longer backs
the plan and is instead focused on improving and expanding ObamaCare. Her campaign website
says she will ""make affordable health care a right not a privilege by expanding and strengthening
the Affordable Care Act and making permanent the Biden-Harris tax credit enhancements that are
lowering health care premiums by an average of about $800 a year for millions of Americans.""
Jindal however is skeptical of that denial.
""When politicians tell you and show you what they believe I think we should believe them"" he said.
""What's more likely? That she's all of a sudden changed her mind and she won't tell us that herself?
She won't tell us why she changed her mind. She won't tell us what new policy she supports. Or is it
more likely she'll simply say whatever it takes to get elected but still has the same radical beliefs
that she's always had before?""
NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION BORDER
SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE
Jindal warns that not only would it put intense pressure on the health care system and lead to
worse coverage for Americans but it would also encourage more illegal immigration.""This is literally a gold-plated invitation for new immigrants. She hasn't suggested simply that she
just wants to add the 12 million illegal immigrants that are already here into Medicare. What she is
saying is hey those that are here those that can get here we want to put you into Medicare. What
does that say to illegal immigrants that haven't even gotten here yet? What does that say to people
all over the world? If you can make your way here Kamala Harris wants to give you access to
Medicare.""

Vice President Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over former President Trump in the latest Fox

ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%) for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.
Among likely voters the race flips with Trump on top by just a single point 50% to 49%.
When third-party candidates are included Harris is up 1 point among registered voters (3% support
third party) while Trump is up 2 points among likely voters (3% to others).

GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE
The results among both registered and likely voters are within the margin of error.
Harris?s strongest support comes from Black voters urban voters and college-educated women
while for Trump it is Whites without a college degree (particularly men without degrees) rural voters
and White evangelicals.
Most Democrats (98%) and Republicans (96%) back their party?s candidate while the small group
of independents favors Harris by 7 points.
Slightly more Harris supporters (92%) than Trump supporters (89%) are certain of their choice.
Harris is viewed more positively than Trump among Tar Heel voters ? 50% have a favorable view of
her vs. 49% unfavorable for a +1 net positive rating. Trump?s rating is negative by 7 points (46%favorable 53% unfavorable).
Just 30% say the economy is in either excellent (7%) or good (23%) condition while another 70%
say either fair (30%) or poor (40%). This negativity is a far cry from November 2019 (late into
Trump?s term as president) when 54% were positive and 44% negative.
By 7 points voters are more likely to think Trump can better handle the economy and about the
same number give him the edge on making the country safe (+6). He does best on immigration and
border security where he leads Harris by 15 points down from a 19-point lead in August.
4 MARK ROBINSON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS RESIGN IN WAKE OF REPORT ON PORN
WEBSITE POSTS
Harris does best on the issue of abortion where she is preferred by 16 points. Voters also give her
the edge on helping the middle class (+7) protecting democracy (+6) and fighting for people like
you (+5).
The candidates tie on who can bring needed change.
""The race here will be close but Trump still holds the edge on the issues that matter most to North
Carolina voters"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw who conducts the Fox News Poll along with
Democrat Chris Anderson. ""So long as they think Trump is more likely to make the country more
prosperous and safer he?s the odds-on favorite.""
At least 8 in 10 Black voters think Harris is better equipped to handle these issues and actions
except when it comes to immigration where Trump eats into Harris? lead with 25% saying he wouldbetter handle immigration vs. 73% for Harris.
The survey also finds the gap in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina has widened. Democrat
Josh Stein (56%) has a 16-point lead over Republican Mark Robinson (40%) a 5-point increase
since last month (54% Stein 43% Robinson).
The survey was conducted after news of alleged inflammatory comments Robinson made on a porn
website.
""It is unlikely the toxic nature of the Republican gubernatorial candidate will cause Trump voters to
switch to Harris but it could affect turnout"" says Anderson. ""It complicates things for the Trump
campaign to have to actively avoid the GOP candidate and there could be some Trump-leaning
independents who are so turned off by Robinson they decide it?s not worth voting.""
Trump endorsed Robinson in March but has yet to comment on whether he?ll pull his support.
Some 14% of Stein supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race while just
4% of Robinson supporters back Harris.
A few more things?
-- By 17 points those who say they will vote early in North Carolina back Harris. Among the smaller
group of Election Day voters Trump leads by 20 points.
--The views of the vice-presidential candidates play out the same as the presidential with Minnesota
Democratic Gov. Tim Walz receiving a net positive rating of 5 (46% favorable vs. 41% unfavorable)and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance net negative by 6 (41-47%).
--Views of President Joe Biden are net negative by 15 points (42% favorable 57% unfavorable).

Pennsylvania
Vice President Harris and former President Trump are locked in a tight race in Pennsylvania mostly
unchanged since July. This despite the array of newsworthy events since then including the
Democratic National Convention a presidential debate and a second Trump assassination attempt.
The new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points
(50-48%) among registered voters while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters.
The July results conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris but
before she was conclusively the nominee were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March when
Biden was the presumed nominee the contest was close to even.

Since July Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points) nonwhite voters (+8) and
voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength:
college graduates and urban voters.
Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.
Trump?s best groups include men Whites without a college degree independents and rural voters.
He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.
?ABUSE OF POWER?: HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TOBATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA
Another reason the race is close is Trump has minimized Harris? edge among suburban voters (+2).
This is mostly due to the large gender gap among suburban voters: suburban men support Trump
by 14 points (suburban women go for Harris by 17). Meanwhile Harris has successfully peeled off
disaffected Republicans: she has 1 in 4 non-MAGA Republicans backing her.
In 2016 Trump beat Hillary Clinton by less than a point in the Keystone State while Biden?s victory
was by just over a point in 2020.
In the expanded ballot (includes third-party candidates) Harris has a 2-point edge among registered
voters while Trump is ahead by 1 point among likely voters.
All results for the Harris-Trump head-to-heads and expanded ballot are within the error margin .
""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn?t be expected to"" says Democratic Pollster Chris
Anderson who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates
have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could
determine who wins the state.""
The economy is the top issue for voters this election and most Pennsylvanians have a negative view
of the economy (71%).
More voters think Trump can better handle the economy than Harris by 6 points. Still that?s half the
advantage he had on the issue in April (+12 points over Biden).Trump does best on immigration and border security (+17) and is also more trusted to make the
country safer (+5).
Harris is seen as better able to handle abortion by 21 points. She also gets the nod on helping the
middle class (by 8 points) protecting Democracy (+7) and fighting for people like you (+5).
Neither has a clear edge in bringing needed change (Harris +3)
Harris enjoys better favorable ratings than the former president -- 48% favorable vs. 51%
unfavorable for a 3-point net negative rating. Trump is underwater by 9 points (45% vs. 54%). It
plays out the same way among the vice-presidential candidates: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz?s rating
is even (44% vs. 44%) while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is in negative territory by 13 points (39% vs. 52%).
Biden?s favorable rating is underwater by 16 points (42% vs. 58%).
In the Pennsylvania Senate race Democratic candidate Bob Casey has a 9-point lead over
Republican challenger David McCormick (53% to 44% among both registered and likely voters).
McCormick has narrowed the gap by 4 points since July when he was down by 13 (55-42%).
The reversal can mostly be attributed to a 13-point shift among men and a decrease in support for
Casey among independents. In July men supported Casey by 6 points while today they back
McCormick by 7 points while independents supported Casey by 18 points in the summer and it?s a
5-point spread now.
Some 10% of Casey backers split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race while just 4%
of McCormick supporters go for Harris.A few more things?
-- Gov. Josh Shapiro is popular as 62% approve of the job he?s doing while a third disapprove
(36%). Most Democrats (92%) and over half of independents (53%) approve of him while two-thirds
of Republicans (65%) disapprove.
-- A majority of Pennsylvanians favor the use of fracking for oil and gas production including 8 in 10
Republicans 6 in 10 independents and 4 in 10 Democrats.

44,Conservative,FOX News,"Fox News Poll: Harris is ahead of Trump by 3 points in Georgia
In a head-to-head matchup Vice President Kamala Harris tops former President Trump by 3
percentage points in a Fox News survey of Georgia voters.
Harris receives 51% support to Trump?s 48% among both registered and likely voters. While her
advantage may be narrow (inside the margin of error) it is steady. Last month she was up
50%-48% among registered voters.
Roughly 1 in 10 of each candidate?s supporters say they may change their mind.
More Georgians see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class and protect democracy
by a 3-point margin on each. She is also seen as the candidate more likely to fight ""for people like
you"" by 6 points. Harris? largest lead is on handling the issue of abortion where she is favored by
18 points.
Trump?s largest lead is on handling immigration (+15 points).
HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE
The two candidates are rated more closely on bringing needed change (Harris by 4 points) making
the country safe (Trump +3) and handling the economy (Trump +4). His advantage on the economy
today is half what it was last month.
Large majorities of Black voters trust Harris over Trump on each issue and trait with as many as
85% saying she will ""fight for people like you.""Among independents 6 in 10 see Harris as helping the middle class while nearly as many say
Trump is better able to handle the economy.
""Georgia is looking like a true battleground with a slight lean toward Harris"" says Democratic
pollster Chris Anderson who conducts Fox News polls with Republican Daron Shaw. ""More voters
see her fighting for them and standing up for the middle class and she has almost neutralized
Trump?s advantage on the economy.""
Party loyalty is also a factor. By a 4-percentage point margin more Democrats back Harris than
Republicans back Trump. One in five non-MAGA Republicans supports Harris.
Independents favor Harris over Trump by 13 points.
Trump won Georgia by 4 percentage points in 2016 but Biden took the state in 2020 by less than
half a point.
By a wide 30-point margin Georgia voters like the job Gov. Brian Kemp is doing: 64% approve vs.
34% disapprove (August 2024).
""The pathway for Trump is pretty obvious"" says Shaw. ""He has to make nice with Gov. Kemp and
non-MAGA Republicans ? and if he does that he probably has the edge.""
Harris gets her best numbers from Black voters urban voters those under age 30 and women.
Majorities of Whites without a college degree rural voters men and voters ages 65 and over
support Trump.New voters split 50%-50% (those who haven?t voted in the four most recent general elections).
Married voters go for Trump by 15 points while those who are unmarried favor Harris by 21.
Most voters who say they will cast their ballot early prefer Harris while Trump is favored among
those planning to vote on Election Day.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE
Meanwhile Harris is generally more popular than Trump. By a 3-point margin the vice president
receives net positive ratings as 51% have a favorable view of her and 48% unfavorable. Trump?s
ratings are net negative by 6 points (47% vs. 53%).
The same goes for the vice-presidential candidates. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in positive territory
by 1 point (43%-42%) while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is underwater by 3 (43%-46%).

45,Conservative,FOX News,"Fox News Poll: Trump ahead of Harris by 2 points nationally
Former President Trump is ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest
50%-48% according to a new Fox News national survey. That?s a reversal from last month when
Harris had a narrow advantage.
Harris however is ahead by 6 points among voters from the seven key battleground states (within
the margin of error for that subsample) and the candidates are tied at 49% each among voters in
close counties (where the Biden-Trump 2020 margin was less than 10 points). Trump?s advantage
comes from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points in 2020 (64%-35%) than
Harris has in counties Biden won by more than 10 points (58%-39%).
That raises the question of whether the Democrat could win the Electoral College while losing the
national popular vote. In 2000 and 2016 it was the GOP candidate who lost the popular vote but
won the Electoral College.
Trump?s 2-point edge among likely voters falls well within the margin of error. The results are
identical among the larger group of registered voters. Last month Harris was up by 2 points
(50%-48%) among both likely and registered voters.
WALZ SILENT ON SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING ELECTORAL COLLEGE AFTER HARRIS
CAMP SAYS IT DOESN'T BACK BAN
This analysis uses registered voter results for apples-to-apples trend comparisons.
These are Trump?s best numbers since Harris became the nominee in August. The movement
toward him mainly comes from an increase in support among White voters who now favor him by10 points up from 4 points last month and 6 points in August. He is also at record highs among
voters 65 and over (49%) and those with a college degree (48%).
At the same time Harris receives her lowest support since becoming the nominee among Black
voters (67%) college graduates (49%) voters 65 and over (47%) and Whites with a college degree
(46%).
TRIO OF NEW POLLS AGREE ON WHERE TRUMP AND HARRIS STAND WITH 3 WEEKS TO
GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY
Yet on the surface the race has stayed within a small range. In August Trump was ahead by 1
point then Harris was up by 2 points in September and now Trump has a 2-point edge.
""Overall the movement toward Trump is subtle but potentially consequential especially if he is
making gains among college-educated voters"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who
conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. ""However the race has been well within
the margin of error for three months and the outcome will likely hinge on which side is more effective
at getting their voters to the polls as opposed to persuasion.""
The 20-point gender gap remains as men back Trump and women go for Harris.
The good news for Harris is she gets 52% of new voters (those who haven?t voted in the last two
presidential elections) and 20% of non-MAGA Republicans.
She is also maintaining her double-digit lead over Trump among independents. That keeps the
contest close as each candidate receives backing from over 9 in 10 of their respective partisans. Onthe other hand more voters nationally identify as Republican than Democrat and that is what gives
Trump the edge in this race.
While the vice president gets majority support among Hispanics (52%) and voters under age 30
(54%) both numbers trail President Biden?s support in 2020 according to the Fox News Voter
Analysis election survey (6 in 10 from each group).
For Trump the good news is that he has improved on every issue and character trait since
September. And a majority remember his time in office positively: 53% approve of the job he did as
president. That is 4 points higher than he ever received while in office. Fully 93% of Republicans
approve as do 74% of non-MAGA Republicans and 45% of independents.
HARRIS RAMPS UP OUTREACH TO BLACK MALE VOTERS AS POLLS SUGGEST TRUMP
MAKING GAINS
By comparison currently only 40% of voters approve of Biden?s job performance which matches
previous lows in November 2023 and July 2022.
Only slightly more 43% approve of the government?s response to recent hurricanes with most
Democrats approving and most Republicans and independents disapproving.
The economy continues to outrank all other issues as 40% say it is the most important issue in
deciding their choice for president. Less than half as many prioritize immigration and abortion and
far fewer cite issues such as election integrity health care climate change guns crime and foreign
policy.Seven in 10 view the economy negatively. The 30% who rate conditions positively is up from a low
of 17% in 2022 and close to the 33% who felt good about the economy at the end of Trump?s term.
Half of Democrats give positive ratings while majorities of Republicans and independents rate
economic conditions negatively.
Overall 44% say they are falling behind financially which is worse by 17 points compared to three
years ago when only 27% felt that way. Some 13% feel they are getting ahead financially while
43% are holding steady.
Trump is seen as better than Harris at handling the economy (by 8 points). He also bests her on
immigration (+15) crime (+8) and guns (+6). With the expanding conflict in the Middle East it is
noteworthy that Trump is favored by 13 points on Israel and the war up from a 7-point lead in
September. He has improved his standing on every issue compared to September mostly by small
margins.
More voters trust Harris to handle abortion (by 14 points) climate change (+12) and health care
(+8). The two candidates are rated about evenly on taxes (Trump +4) Supreme Court nominations
(Trump +1) and election integrity (Harris +3).
""Sometimes elections are simple"" says Shaw. ""In three weeks we may be wondering how we
thought the sitting vice president would win when only two in five voters think the incumbent
administration has done a good job and only one in seven say they are getting ahead financially.""
Democrats and Republicans prioritize the issues differently with the widest gap (28 points) on
immigration. There?s an 18-point gap on abortion and 15 points on the economy.Some 12% of Democrats see Trump as better at handling the economy and 18% feel that way
about immigration while 17% of Republicans trust Harris more on abortion and climate change.
NEW POLL SHOWS HARRIS TRUMP SPLITTING 2 KEY STATES
Trump is helped by more voters saying they know a great deal about where he stands on their
priority issues than they do about Harris (57% vs. 44%). Fully 78% of Republicans feel they know a
great deal about Trump?s stances while 65% of Democrats say the same about Harris.
Less than half believe Trump (43%) and Harris (48%) are honest and trustworthy though Trump?s
number is a personal best. Voters are also more likely to see him as a strong leader (55% vs. 47%
for Harris) and ""up to the job"" of president (53% vs. 50%). Harris has an edge in having the mental
soundness to be president (54% vs. 52% for Trump) but here again Trump is at a personal best.
Harris has lost ground on some key characteristics. She was seen as better at helping the middle
class by 9 points in September and that has declined to 4 points now. Her 5-point edge on ""fighting
for people like you"" is now 2 points and her 6-point advantage on ""protecting personal rights and
freedoms"" has disappeared as the candidates are tied.
Voters also narrowly see Trump as the one bringing needed change and protecting free speech
both traits where Harris was favored last month.
The race continues to be more about Trump than Harris as most of his backers say their vote is for
him rather than against Harris. Among Harris supporters two-thirds describe their vote as for her
but one-third say it is against Trump. For comparison in May nearly half of Biden supporters said
their vote was mainly against Trump. Among Trump supporters 80% say they are voting for himrather than against Harris (18%).
When saying in their own words what one issue or factor was motivating them to get out and vote
this year the top response from Harris supporters is dislike of the other candidate followed by
protecting democracy and abortion. For those backing Trump the economy and immigration are the
top two motivators followed by candidate characteristics. Among men it?s dislike of the other
candidate the economy and traits (in that order) while for women the economy and abortion tie as
the top motivator followed by candidate traits.

suggests a win in the Electoral College. In 2016 Hillary Clinton got more votes nationally by a

advantage in the popular vote and won the Electoral College (by 74).

46,Conservative,FOX News,"Fox News Power Rankings: Harris ticks up and Senate Republicans
take charge
Republicans are set to flip the Senate for the first time this cycle in this week?s Fox News Power
Rankings .
Meanwhile Vice President Kamala Harris enjoys a small post-debate bump three new toss-up
races emerge in the House and the GOP loses ground on the governor map.
Harris comes out stronger from the first debate
Two weeks after their first debate Harris is up a point and former President Trump is down the
same in an average of high-quality polls.
If those numbers sound familiar it is because they match the shifts after the first debate between
President Biden and Trump four years ago.
That could be a problem for Republicans. In 2020 Trump did not narrow the polling gap that the first
debate created until a stronger showing in the second. As of today Harris and Trump have not
agreed on terms for a rematch.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS THINK HARRIS DID BETTER THAN TRUMP IN DEBATE
Harris? improvement comes from independents more than any other group. They backed Trump by
8 points in a Fox News survey last month but now prefer Harris by 12. Biden won independents by
15 points in the last election so an enduring Harris lead in this group could give her an edge on
election night. (Poll results among subgroups can be volatile.)The same post-debate poll has Trump down two points among all voters leaving the former
president at 48% and Harris at 50%. A spread like that on election night gives Trump an electoral
college advantage .
Further slippage in support for the former president would change that math.
Republicans are poised to control the Senate
Republicans have enjoyed a head start in the Senate from the beginning of this cycle. Their star
candidate in Montana is doing more than anyone to get them to the finish line.
The latest forecast predicts Republicans will take at least 51 seats on election night while
Democrats are expected to take at least 47. That leaves two races in the Toss Up category.
Montana moves out of that category this week.
This state has been represented for nearly two decades by Democratic Sen. Jon Tester one of the
last rural Democrats who has leaned on his farming background and gun rights advocacy to exceed
expectations in three elections.
However Trump won the state by 16 points in 2020 and Tester faces a strong opponent in
businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. He has run an efficient disciplined campaign on
the economy and the border.
That makes Montana a better pickup opportunity for the GOP than Ohio which does not lean towardTrump as much as its western neighbor and where Republican candidate Bernie Moreno has made
missteps on the trail.
Sheehy leads with 51% to Tester?s 45% in an AARP poll conducted in late August. The incumbent
Democrat is ahead among independents but that is not enough to overcome this conservative
electorate.
Sitting among the peaks that shape Montana?s landscape is a mountain of cash. Over $121 million
has been spent by the campaigns and outside groups so far according to OpenSecrets  with at
least $100 million more in reserved spending . That is an extraordinary sum for a race that isn?t
competitive at the presidential level and equates to more than $150 per registered voter.
That is what keeps this race tight. Tester has more than three times as much cash on hand as
Sheehy giving the Democrat spending money for local advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts.
If that cash can push this race back within the margin of error Democrats have a shot at retaining
the upper house.
EARLY VOTING MEANS ?ELECTION SEASON' HAS ALREADY BEGUN
Montana moves from Toss Up to Lean R.
With 22 toss-up races the House is up for grabs
The House is still a toss-up in the latest forecast. In fact with three more races joining that category
it is less clear than ever which direction the lower chamber will take.California?s 45th district: President Biden won this southern California district by 6 points last cycle (
Dave?s Redistricting ) but its heavy and right-leaning Asian American population makes it highly
competitive. Republicans are pouring money into the race to protect incumbent Rep. Michelle Steel
whose position on abortion could be an issue with Los Angeles-area voters. She faces Democratic
lawyer Derek Tran. This race moves from Lean R to Toss Up.
Iowa?s 1st district: A recent Des Moines Register survey showing Harris 4 points behind Trump
raised eyebrows in the Iowa presidential race. It could have a downballot impact as well.
Second-term GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks won by six votes in 2020 and while redistricting
gave her a more comfortable win in the midterms she remains vulnerable in this Davenport and
Iowa City district. Former State Representative Christina Bohannan is the Democratic candidate.
Iowa?s 1st district moves from Likely R to Toss Up.
Nebraska?s 2nd district: This Omaha-centered district has been represented by Republican Rep.
Don Bacon since 2017. Bacon and the district made news last week when he signed a letter calling
for Nebraska to become a ""winner-take-all"" state before the presidential election. The gamble would
have helped Trump if it had succeeded but calling for the change could put Bacon in danger with
some of the centrist voters he has relied on in previous elections. He faces Democratic State Sen.
Tony Vargas. This district moves from Lean R to Toss Up.
NEBRASKA GOP SENATOR OPPOSES ELECTORAL COLLEGE CHANGE THAT MAY HAVE
HELPED TRUMP WIN RE-ELECTION
Republicans run from Robinson in North CarolinaFinally a sleepy gubernatorial cycle had its wake-up call last Thursday when CNN reported that
North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov Mark Robinson referred to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn
website he frequented between 2008 and 2012. He denied the report.
Robinson is more than embattled in this race. At least four senior staffers have resigned from his
campaign allies have jumped ship and the Republican Governors Association is not spending
another dollar on advertising.
No one knows how this will impact Trump. Voting has begun with Robinson?s name a few rows
down from Trump?s on the ballot and Democrats are reminding voters about the strong consistent
praise that the former president has offered Robinson. However calcified support for Trump among
Republicans and the state?s history of ticket splitting should keep him competitive.
In the meantime the Power Rankings already had the governor?s race at Lean D because of
previous Robinson scandals. Now it moves to Likely D.
Voting underway with six weeks to go until election day
Voting has begun in 21 states including Wisconsin North Carolina Minnesota and Virginia. By the
end of the month more than half of all states will send ballots to voters.
While many voters are expected to cast a ballot early election day itself is only six weeks away.
Next week vice presidential hopefuls Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance R-Ohio will
participate in a debate hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate
with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",FOX News_Fox_News_Power_Rankings_Harris_ticks_up_and_Senate.pdf.pdf,news_articles

48,Conservative,FOX News,"Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October
A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri
was decided by less than 4000 votes.
They?ve all happened in the last twenty years.
These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008 2004 and 2008
again). At the time they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.
Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close one unexpected
flip can decide who wins the White House.
Harris still closer to 270 than Trump but it?s anyone?s game
Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week?s forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home
at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump?s 219.
Her advantage is no larger than it was in September and as this column has mentioned 
battleground states are usually ? and mostly ? won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this
forecast are worth 78 votes enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.
National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at
48%-48% with likely voters while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48% well within the polls?
margins of sampling error.
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUESNeither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point
worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.
Battleground state polls have been sparse. ( Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in
Georgia and North Carolina and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This could
affect the ability to conduct surveys that accurately cover these areas.)
Overall this race is still anyone?s game.
All eyes on an October surprise
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance
mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him while Walz stumbled
out of the gate.
A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always wait for results from multiple
polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.
That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has
proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)
Of course it?s the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And
events in two categories have already resurfaced.
Severe weather : Hurricane Sandy tore through the northeast in late October 2012. PresidentObama?s cooperation with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was a landmark moment. This year
Helene and Milton are testing the candidates. Trump made visits to Georgia and North Carolina last
week and Harris was in Asheville over the weekend with Governor Roy Cooper.
: Hurricane Sandy tore through the northeast in late October 2012. President Obama?s cooperation
with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was a landmark moment. This year Helene and Milton are
testing the candidates. Trump made visits to Georgia and North Carolina last week and Harris was
in Asheville over the weekend with Governor Roy Cooper. Foreign policy: A video from Osama Bin
Laden four days before the 2004 election refocused the race on 9/11 national security and
America?s war on terrorism. Yesterday marked a year since Hamas? terrorist attack in Israel and
war rages between Ukraine and Russia; both are reminders of global instability during the Biden
Administration.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE
Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump?s
support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in
2020 and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark .
Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.
Two states that could surprise in November
There are ten ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map including New Hampshire Iowa Ohio and
Texas. Two that could have a big impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.
Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential electionbringing his margin up to about 372000 votes.
That?s a win of 3.4 points or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North
Carolina a toss-up in the rankings which he won by 1.3 points.)
Republicans have strong advantages. The state?s White working-class and senior voters lean
towards Trump while its large Hispanic population particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan
communities has shifted right in recent years.
The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration
advantage and most tellingly the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.
Today a new poll from the New York Times/Siena finds Trump up 13 points at 55% to Harris' 41%
among likely voters. Other polls have shown a closer spread.
Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has
personally spent more than $8 million means the presidential election is closer than people think.
Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.
It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after
the battlegrounds to go blue.
Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.
A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking especially since Biden won this state by more
than 10 points in 2020.The state has a higher proportion of Black suburban and college-educated voters than the rest of
the country and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about
Virginia after the June presidential debate the race has changed and neither party is making big
investments in the state today.
Some polls show a race that isn?t over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth
University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the
Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump?s 42%.
Still it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia
remains a Likely D race.
There are four likely races on the Senate map  including Florida Texas and the regular election in
Nebraska which moved out of the solid category for Republicans last week. Incumbent Republican
Sen. Deb Fischer has won the seat twice but independent opponent Dan Osborn a Navy veteran
and local union leader is mounting a serious challenge.
The campaigns are spending heavily in all three Likely R races.
Four weeks until election night
Roughly 1.7 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early
voting has now begun in:
The three most populated states: California Texas  and Florida and More than half the battleground states: Georgia  Michigan  North Carolina  Pennsylvania 
and Wisconsin (plus Nebraska  where the 2nd district is ranked Lean D).

49,Conservative,FOX News,"Fox News Power Rankings: Voter outreach ballot efficiency and a
little Housekeeping
Election night is two weeks away. As Vice President Harris and former President Trump dash to the
finish line this week?s forecast looks at their outreach efforts and the latest evidence of a smaller
divide between national and state polling.
Plus rankings changes in six competitive House districts.
Harris and Trump meet voters where they are
Last week?s Power Rankings showed that both parties? coalitions have changed meaningfully since
2020.
For Democrats the chief concern is that Harris still has fewer Black voters in her corner than
President Biden.
To help fix that problem the campaign dispatched its strongest surrogate former President Obama
to Arizona and Nevada and Harris spent an hour with Charlamagne Tha God to talk about policy
race and religion.
The Vice President also went head-to-head with Fox News? Bret Baier part of an effort by her
campaign to frame the candidate as tough and pragmatic. It was Harris? highest-profile interview
yet but it will take another week before the effects show up in polls.
Meanwhile Trump?s coalition has fewer women than in the last election so the former President
participated in a town hall with Fox News? Harris Faulkner and an all-female audience.Trump also continues to search for young and working-class voters. His appearance at a local
McDonald?s in Pennsylvania produced some compelling imagery and was designed to paint Trump
as an energetic and likable candidate.
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS LOSES HER LEAD AND A NEW ELECTORATE
EMERGES
Right-wing voters with reservations about Trump could also make the difference on election night.
That is why Harris spent the beginning of the week with Republican former congresswoman Liz
Cheney who urged conservatives to vote for the Democratic ticket this year. It also explains why
there are rumblings about Nikki Haley joining Trump on the campaign trail.
Inefficient vote could keep Harris in the game
Two polls of the national popular vote released last week show a uniquely tight race. Suffolk has
Harris one point ahead of Trump at 50% to 49%; the Fox News Poll has Trump up by two with the
former president at 50% and Harris at 48%.
Results like that should make this Trump?s race to lose.
In 2020 Biden won the national vote by 4.5 points (51%-47%). That translated to very thin margins
of victory in the battleground states. The president won Georgia for example by 0.2 points and his
largest victory in any battleground was by 2.8 points in Michigan.Close national polls should therefore put Trump in the lead in the battlegrounds. But the statewide
polls are close too.
A new set of polls show Harris ahead by 2-4 points in Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin and
Georgia a tied race in Nevada and Trump ahead by 3 in Arizona and North Carolina (Washington
Post/Schar).
The Power Rankings call all those states toss-ups.
Last week the same Fox poll that put Trump ahead by two points nationally had Harris up six points
among voters who live in the battleground states (52%-46% with a 6.5-point subgroup margin of
error).
Trump?s advantage primarily came from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points
in 2020 (64-35%) than Harris had in counties Biden won by more than 10 points (58-39%).
A TRUMP MYSTERY MAKES ELECTION OUTCOME EVEN MURKIER
The results suggest that Trump could be banking ""inefficient vote."" In other words while the former
president is performing better nationally than he was four years ago the gains are concentrated in
places he is already winning like Florida or rural counties.
While Harris may have lost some ground in safe Democratic states like New York she remains
competitive in the battlegrounds that decide the presidential election.
Other polls have raised the same question but the most compelling evidence comes from themidterms.
Republicans received about 3 million more votes than Democrats in the national House vote (Cook)
but eked out a balance of power win with 222 seats to Democrats? 213.
Put another way the GOP banked a lot of votes in areas where it didn?t need them and just
enough in the battleground House races that would give them victory (a problem that has plagued
the Democrats in the national vote for years).
The polls are all within the margin of error and this is just one theory about the direction of the race.
But on election night a Trump blowout in Florida or a narrower spread in Virginia may not mean the
race is over.
Six House races shift directions
The House is still a toss-up with 208 seats in the Republican columns 205 for the Democrats and
22 districts that could go either way.
In today?s forecast six races move to new categories:
First New York?s 17th district in the Hudson Valley is home to one of the most competitive races
on the map. Incumbent GOP Rep. Mike Lawler has a strong bipartisan brand in a centrist district.
While Democratic challenger and former Rep. Mondaire Jones has tried to head in the same
direction he?s still dogged by his previous support for defunding the police and a spat with the
Working Families Party (Jones will not appear on the ballot under that party?s name though the
party is now telling voters to support him anyway). This race moves from Toss Up to Lean R.New York?s 1st district home to both the Hamptons and rural farmland on Long Island remains a
competitive race between Republican Rep. Nick LaLota and the Democrat former CNN anchor
John Avlon. But the majority of this district?s voters backed Trump in 2020 and 2016 and Avlon has
faced questions over the extent of his residency in the district. The race moves from Lean R to
Likely R.
In the battleground Rust Belt states a pair of districts held by pro-Trump Republicans have become
even more competitive. First Wisconsin?s 3rd district flipped to Rep. Derrick Van Orden in the
midterms by a tight margin. The incumbent?s presence at the U.S. Capitol during the January 6 riots
is a theme in his opponent's ads. This race moves from Likely R to Lean R.
Meanwhile Pennsylvania?s 10th district has been held by Freedom Caucus Rep. Scott Perry since
2013. Perry is the only sitting member of Congress whose cellphone was seized by the FBI in its
investigation into efforts to illegally overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and that
has also become a theme in television ads. It moves from Lean R to Toss Up.
Nevada?s 3rd district is still the best opportunity for Republicans to flip a seat in the Silver State but
a hotly competitive presidential race hasn?t so far translated into downballot success particularly in
the Senate race. This district almost touches Las Vegas and includes Henderson. That?s favorable
territory for Democratic Rep. Susie Lee in this Biden-majority district. She faces Republican Drew
Johnson. It moves from Lean D to Likely D.
Finally a sleeper race to watch in the northeast: Maryland?s 6th district where Democrat April
McClain Delaney faces Republican Neil Parrott. This should be safe territory for the left but the
party is investing here and even made it part of one of its frontline programs. It moves from Solid Dto Likely D.
Lies damned lies and statistics
As an anxious electorate counts down to election night the political class is filling the void with data.
Some numbers are more useful than others.
Harris dominates in fundraising and the ground game. Her campaign raised more than $1 billion this
quarter and more than double what Trump raised in the last month and Democrats have a much
stronger get-out-the-vote operation. These are important advantages. In a tight race they may get
Harris over the line. On the other hand Trump has won with deficits in both areas.
Comparing early vote figures to previous cycles is generally unhelpful. We expect fewer Americans
to vote early Democrats and Republicans are less likely to be divided on how they cast ballots and
breakdowns tell us the party registration of some voters not how they voted.
Finally since internal polls survey the same electorate as any other poll they?re unlikely to produce
a clearly different result. When they do people should question whether the poll is an outlier or
whether the campaign that paid for the poll has a motive to characterize the race differently.
Two weeks until election night
Early voting is underway in every state with more than fifteen million voters now casting a ballot.

50,Conservative,FOX News,"GOP challenger ties Sen Baldwin's remark about Trump voters to
Clinton's infamous 'deplorables' moment
FIRST ON FOX: Republican businessman Eric Hovde is using Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin's
previous comments on Trump supporters against her as he looks to unseat her in the critical swing
state of Wisconsin.
In a new ad by the Hovde campaign Baldwin says ""Donald Trump might be one of the most
offensive hateful and unacceptable presidential candidates we've ever had. So what does that say
about the people who support him?""
The remark which is from a 2016 speech is cut next to former Democrat presidential nominee
Hillary Clinton's infamous ""basket of deplorables"" comment which was credited by some with
costing her the election to then-Republican nominee Donald Trump.
SENATE SHAKE-UP: HOW A SECRET BALLOT COULD UNDERMINE A POTENTIAL TRUMP
ENDORSEMENT IN RACE TO THE TOP
The ad will run on television across Wisconsin starting Tuesday and is part of an ongoing
multimillion dollar statewide ad campaign.
""Tammy Baldwin hates Trump and Trump voters just listen to her own words when it comes to what
she thinks about them. Much like Hillary Clinton the disdain Baldwin has for Wisconsin?s Trump
voters will haunt her on Election Day"" Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon said in a statement.
HOVDE SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON TAMMY BALDWIN'S WALL STREET PARTNER DURING
WISCONSIN DEBATEIn response a Baldwin spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement ""Tammy Baldwin fights
for all Wisconsinites no matter who they are who they vote for or where they live. That stands in
stark contrast to her opponent Eric Hovde who has literally called Wisconsinites deplorable
Democrats a ?curse to society? and insulted our farmers seniors young people women Black
men Native American communities and more.""
The Democrat senator's campaign also pointed to an interview on ""The Jerry Bader Show"" in 2016
in which Hovde used the word ""deplorable"" to describe the level of civic knowledge among average
Americans with many not knowing the year of the country's founding or who the vice president is.
JUDGE ORDERS MORE JACK SMITH TRUMP INVESTIGATION DOCS TO BE MADE PUBLIC
AHEAD OF ELECTION
In a recent Quinnipiac University poll of the Senate race Baldwin beat Hovde 50% to 46%. The
small single-digit lead marks a significant closure of the initial polling gap between the incumbent
Democrat and her GOP challenger.
The survey was conducted between Oct. 3 and 7 and included 1073 likely voters. It had a margin of
error of +/- 3 percentage points.

51,Conservative,FOX News,"GOP urges 'transparency' on whether Walz admin removing
noncitizens from Minnesota voter rolls
FIRST ON FOX ? House Republicans from Minnesota joined the Republican National Committee
(RNC) in demanding that Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz's administration
provide an update on voter roll cleanup efforts after it was discovered that noncitizens and
otherwise ineligible individuals were improperly registered to vote under the state's automatic voter
registration process.
Reps. Tom Emmer Brad Finstad Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber signed onto a follow-up
letter RNC election integrity counsel Kevin J. Cline and Minnesota Republican Party Chairman
David Hann sent this week. The letter addressed to Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and
Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson acknowledged
communication between their offices for over a month.
The Republicans said they provided Simon and Jacobson's offices ""with the information necessary
to remove known noncitizens from the Minnesota voter rolls over a month ago"" and ""despite our
continued efforts to receive updates on the actions your office is taking it took over three (3) weeks
to get any information which came on the same day you released the information to the public.""
""Commissioner Jacobson?s September 12 letter admits there were approximately 1000 individuals
who may have been improperly registered to vote under the automatic voter registration ('AVR')
process"" Cline and Hann wrote. ""This leads us and others to consider all means necessary to
obtain transparency from your office. To this end we are now joined by Congressman Tom Emmer
Congressman Brad Finstad Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach and Congressman Pete Stauber
to demand you provide further answers on this disastrous failure.""RNC BLASTS WALZ ADMIN'S NONANSWER ON HOW NONCITIZENS MADE IT ONTO
MINNESOTA VOTER ROLLS: 'NO HYPOTHETICAL'
The letter demands the Walz administration provide ""the exact number of individuals who were
inactivated"" answer what ""the different categories of information the individual records were
missing"" are and ""provide how many individuals were inactivated for each category of missing
information."" It also asks Simon and Jacobson how many of the inactivated individuals have voted in
a past election how many of the inactivated individuals were sent ballots in past elections and if
those people will ""be able to register and vote in the November election?""
""Would eliminating any of the inactivated individuals? votes have changed the outcome of any past
elections?"" the letter asks. It also asks both Walz administration officials when they plan to
""complete your confirmation of each individual?s voter registration information?""
""It is imperative that Minnesota voters trust in the State?s election system which includes knowing
the voter rolls only consist of legally registered voters"" Cline and Hann wrote.
Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of both Simon and Jacobson regarding the letter but did
not immediately hear back.
The RNC and Minnesota GOP first wrote to the Walz administration in August flagging how a
noncitizen legally living in the state and fearful of jeopardizing his status came forward to report
receiving a primary ballot without having registered to vote. In past letters Cline and Hann have
cited how Walz in March 2023 signed a bill into law allowing noncitizens to receive driver?s licensesalso known as ""Driver License for All."" Less than two months after signing that bill into law Walz
signed the ""Democracy for the People Act"" permitting automatic voter registration through the
Department of Public Safety?s Driver and Vehicle Services (DVS).
MINNESOTA GOP DEMANDS PROBE AFTER NONCITIZEN CLAIMS RECEIVING PRIMARY
BALLOT WITHOUT REGISTERING TO VOTE
The Republicans claim that Jacobson in particular has only described how the DVS division is
supposed to function to ensure each applicant is a U.S. citizen ? and has not explained how
noncitizens ""made it through that process and ultimately made it onto Minnesota?s voter rolls."" In
early September Cline and Hann wrote to Jacobson: ""This is no hypothetical; lawfully present
noncitizens were registered to vote through your department and Minnesota voters deserve
transparency from your department to understand how this failure occurred and how it is being
addressed.""
In a Sept. 12 news release Simon's office admitted that ""DVS flagged a small number of applicant
files as needing additional confirmation of voter registration information including address name
and citizenship."" The announcement focused on how 65339 Minnesotans had registered to vote
and 25572 16- and 17-year-olds preregistered to vote but also explained ""changes made to internal
processes.""
The Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State said it was partnering with the DVS division ""to
ensure the process works as expected and that only eligible Minnesotans are being registered to
vote.""
""That partnership includes a manual two-layer review by DVS of all applicant files it sends to theOffice of Secretary of State to be registered or pre-registered to vote. During this review DVS
flagged a small number of applicant files as needing additional confirmation of voter registration
information including address name and citizenship"" the release says.
""Out of an abundance of caution"" the release continues ""the Office of the Secretary of State has
inactivated the voter registrations of any individuals whose registrations DVS flagged. These
individuals may be still eligible to vote but due to human error their documentation was misclassified
or not properly saved to the DVS database. The impacted individuals will be notified that if eligible to
do so they will need to register to vote online with their local election office or in-person at their
polling place on Election Day.""
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Simon's office said that in order to ""add additional quality assurance to the process to catch and
correct the instances of human error"" DVS is now using ""two distinct staff areas to double check all
documentation at DVS before applicant files are sent to be registered to vote."" His office also said
that ""DVS is making sure workers who classify documents are getting increased training and that
automatic voter registration has been paused in certain situations.",FOX News_GOP_urges__transparency__on_whether_Walz_admin_rem.pdf.pdf,news_articles
52,Conservative,FOX News,"GREG GUTFELD: Howard Stern's transformation is based mainly on a
delusional hatred for Trump
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
So The New York Times now claims that even this new so-called ""positive masculinity"" of
progressive men sucks too. The article's written by a feminist named Ruth Whippman. Perfect
name if you ask me. I guess Sarah Ballcrusher was taken. So we can forget toxic masculinity. Now
even positive masculinity is the problem. ""After the cartoon supervillainy of Donald Trump and the
smarmy misogyny of J.D. Vance the positive masculinity of Walz and his ilk is a joyful relief. But for
the next generation of boys we might do better to ditch the masculinity rhetoric altogether."" I know.
She adds ""the idea that boys must use masculinity as a constant reference point for their own value
is harmful to them and others."" Whatever lady. But look what do you expect from the mindset that
thinks women can sport a 5:00 shadow but then mock women who want to be good wives and
mothers? They can no longer define a woman so what the hell do they know about men?
KAMALA HARRIS' HUSBAND DOUG EMHOFF ?RESHAPED THE PERCEPTION OF
MASCULINITY?: MSNBC HOST
Sadly the left's only real masculinity these days is coming from their admirals. But look having a
liberal feminist write about masculinity is like having a vegan review The Outback Steakhouse. She'll
make everyone in the place miserable and you can't trust her with a knife. But it is funny after
300000 years of functional biology featuring both male and female organisms in just the last few
decades we have thoughtful experts deciding that all of that is wrong. What an about-face. It's not
unlike Howard Stern.I mean talk about a transition. On Tuesday he conducted an interview with Kamala Harris that was
so simpering and feminine that I got my period while listening to it. You should hear what keeps him
up at night.
HOWARD STERN: This is what keeps me up at night. I don't understand how my fellow Americans.
I don't even understand how this election is close. And yes I'm voting for you but I would also vote
for that wall over there.
Well he's half right. We do need a wall you know to keep out gang members fentanyl dealers
human traffickers and Ana Navarro. What's funny though is that Stern actually thought that was a
compliment. Stern has become such a wussified sycophant he doesn't realize that telling Kamala
that he'd vote for a wall is telling her that he knows she's as dumb as one. I mean not to mention
Trump is the wall candidate not Cackles McKneepads. Stern got even more pathetic wondering
how she doesn't nap.
HOWARD STERN: When you say you don't nap I get it. Because like what you've taken on is
extraordinarily difficult. And I mean do you feel the pressure of the moment in the sense that like
when I met you out in the hall I said I'm really nervous because I want this to go well for you. I want
it to go well for the country.
HOWARD STERN SAYS HE ?HATES' ANYONE THAT VOTES FOR TRUMP: ?THEY ARE
STUPID I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEM?
Hold on. I need a minute.
All right we're back. Now remember Stern used to throw baloney slices at strippers' butts. Withaccuracy I might add. Now he's worried the possible leader of the free world can't handle his verbal
foot rub. I wonder if he used to get this nervous for the strippers before he'd spank them on their
bare a**es with a dead fish. Here's Stern on anyone daring to poke a little fun at Kamala.
HOWARD STERN: Even when I watched them on Saturday Night Live with the... Where they have
Maya Rudolph playing you. I hate it. I don't want you being made fun of. I...there's too much at
stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now-- I mean as America land of the free
home of the brave I think it's literally on the line.
So a guy who's supposed to be funny for a living now claims her candidacy is too important to joke
about. This is a guy who once joked right after the Columbine massacre that the killers should have
raped the students before killing them. Not that I like that Stern but this pendulum swing from
saying the most tasteless thing in the universe to putting your balls in a tic tac container you've got
to wonder what's going on here. It's striking that the king of the most misogynistic humor ever now
turns into a breathless **** over a progressive hopelessly shallow candidate. But maybe that's the
explanation.
This is Stern's self-imposed penance for subjugating women to demoralizing stunts capitalizing on
desperate females thirsting for attention even if it's from an oily paddle striking their bare a**es.
True much of Stern's transformation is based mainly on a delusional hatred for Trump but it's also
coming from a bottomless hatred for himself and his past. And he's projected his loathing onto
Trump which gains him accolades from his Hamptons neighbors and his new pal Jimmy Kimmel
who's also doing penance for his sins of the past.
But is Howard simply redefining masculinity? And why is it always the male lefties who are so
desperate to get rid of masculinity entirely? It's guilt and self-preservation. Because scrape beneaththe surface of any liberal male and what do you find? A creep. Terrified of his priggish past. Piggish
past. I mean not priggish. What is priggish? And that fear turns them into obedient mouthpieces for
a completely unqualified candidate.

53,Conservative,FOX News,"GREG GUTFELD: Kamala's rehashing Joe's dirty tricks to get elected
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
So this week the National Security Leaders for America a ""bipartisan group of former military and
intel officers"" released a letter endorsing the candidate they think will make a better president. And
it'll make you feel as secure as a broken strap on Brian Stelter's bra. It reads in part ""We are
Republicans Democrats and Independents loyal to the ideals of our nation-- like freedom
democracy and the rule of law -- not to any one individual or party."" Yeah and they want you to
believe the best representative for those ideals is Kamala.
Yes Harris who shows as much respect for rule of law as P Diddy though she's probably a better
rapper. The funniest part? Out of all the names in the letter nine of the biggest ones including
Clapper John Brennan Panetta also signed another letter you might recall. Remember our favorite
pirate Captain Rehab? Remember how he left a laptop full of incriminating evidence at a repair
shop then abandoned it like an out-of-wedlock child? And how messages connecting his old man to
cash dealings with China and Ukraine were wedged between the homemade porn like Hunter and a
hooker sandwich? And how they all denied it even existed when it threatened to derail his father's
campaign for president.
Well then you also remember what saved Joe's candidacy: an open letter-- from 51 former intel
hacks claiming Hunter's laptop had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""
This of course was a lie and also an incorrect use of the word earmarks. They actually meant
hallmark not earmark. Earmark means how the government designates your tax money to spend
like Dana Perino at a tattoo parlor. You know on essential stuff like foreign wars domestic spying
and drag queen story hour.KAMALA HARRIS PLANS TO SKIP HISTORIC AL SMITH DINNER DESPITE LONG-STANDING
TRADITION
Of course once Joe was safely in office that cover story blew up like a Hezbollah pager. But it was
too late. The lie worked. The laptop was real. They knew it was real. They lied because they were
desperate to put the Dems back in power after years of Trump's hideous peace and prosperity.
But that's what spies do. They lie. Ask Dianne Feinstein's driver or Swalwell's mistress or Hochul's
former deputy chief of staff. There are fewer Chinese people in the kitchen at Panda Express. Joe
then used that corrupt letter as a fig leaf to cover his withered dong of deception. Putin has done a
lot of things to be sure but that was 100% Democrat. So yeah the liars who signed that letter also
signed Kamala's endorsement. She'd be so happy to see that provided someone reads it to her. So
they're doing the same thing they did four years ago and for the same reason. It's bad enough Harris
is just rehashing Biden's ideas.
TAYLOR SWIFT'S ENDORSEMENT OF HARRIS DRAWS MIXED REACTION FROM VOTERS:
?IT IS HUGE AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE?
Now she's rehashing his dirty tricks to get elected. She can't even be original when she's being
dishonest. So who would these endorsements sway? Well just look at who's telling you to vote
Democrat. The CIA. The IRS. Dick Cheney. Taylor Swift. All deceptive forces of evil. Especially
Swift. I mean look what she's done to her boyfriend. This season he's scoring less than Brian
Kilmeade at a lesbian coffee shop. Taylor pretended to be a country singer to become America's
sweetheart then turned on us like a hotter thinner and female Liz Cheney.
But who in America was on the fence about this election until a bunch of spies endorsed cacklingMcKnee pads? The last time we saw an act of desperation like this was Pelosi's facelift. One more
and her belly button will be on her forehead. But like Hunter near the end of a cocaine binge they're
grasping at straws. And you'd be too. While the Dems are sweating like Chris Christie in a Zumba
class Trump's meeting voters and ducking bullets. He even joked about being on this show last
week where our 5 million viewers crushed Kamala's massage session like Oprah sitting on a bag of
Doritos. Even though maybe I said on the show you know I don't love this guy.
DONALD TRUMP: But Gutfeld said on the show he said you know I don't love this guy but man
everything he touches he fixes. He gets it done. Our country was doing great. We had the best
economy. And he asked for an interview. And I said you know I'll do it but I'm begrudgingly. Ten
minutes. I don't really want to do it because he doesn't like me. I guess I don't like anybody that
doesn't like me. I'll be honest. When they don't like me I don't like them OK? Sounds childish.
That's the way it is. Call it a personality defect.
I don't like anybody who doesn't like me. That is honesty people. And it looks like more and more
people are liking Trump too. According to the latest New York Times poll Trump leads in the

54,Conservative,FOX News,"Harris-Trump cash dash: Former president looks to flip script with
fundraising swing in oil country
Trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 cash dash former President Trump heads next
week to Texas a state that's long served as an ATM for Republican White House candidates.
Aiming to narrow the fundraising gap with Harris the former president will headline a luncheon Oct.
2 in Midland Texas as he courts donors in oil country. That luncheon will be followed by a cocktail
reception in Houston sources in Trump's political orbit confirmed to Fox News Digital.
Trump will also headline a fundraiser in Dallas during his Texas swing.
According to the latest figures available from the Federal Election Commission Harris hauled in
nearly $190 million in fundraising for her 2024 campaign in August more than quadrupling the $44.5
million that Trump's team reported bringing into his principal campaign account last month.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION
And the vice president's campaign entered September with $235 million cash on hand well ahead
of the $135 million in Trump's coffers according to the FEC filings.
The latest cash figures are another sign of the vice president's surge in fundraising since replacing
President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket over two months ago.
CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN
This isn't the first time Trump's faced a fundraising deficit. He raised less than 2016 Democraticpresidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his White House victory and by President Biden four years
ago in his re-election defeat.
""The Democrats' small-dollar fundraising machine is just better"" acknowledged Dan Eberhart an oil
drilling CEO and prominent Republican donor and bundler who raised big bucks for Trump in the
2020 and 2024 cycles.
Eberhart pointed to Trump's surge in grassroots fundraising earlier this year after he made history
as the first former or current president convicted in a criminal trial and noted that ""Trump is the best
small-dollar fundraiser the Republicans have ever had. But I still think just overall the Democrats'
small-dollar fundraising machine is just better.""
HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: WHICH CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THIS CRUCIAL
ISSUE
The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over
Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped
Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.
Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with
Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.
But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and
mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls
from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in
fundraising didn't last and by early July began to significantly slow down.Biden bowed out of the 2024 race July 21 and the party quickly consolidated around Harris who
instantly saw her fundraising soar spurred by small-dollar donations.
And the Harris campaign spotlighted that the vice president hauled in $47 million in the 24 hours
after her first and likely only debate with Trump earlier this month.
""We've been playing catch-up ever since Act Blue first started figuring out an effective way to mine
the low-dollar small-dollar fundraising"" Republican Jewish Coalition CEO Matt Brooks told Fox
News pointing to the Democrats' on-line fundraising platform.
Brooks who has close ties to the GOP's donor class said while ""there's no question that the
Democrats have perfected"" their small-dollar fundraising ""I think we're doing better and better. I like
the trajectory we're on.""
But a source in Trump's political orbit said ""the max-out donors have already given. There's not a lot
of juice left from that. Any juice left would be in the small-dollar on-line fundraising and the moments
for that are kind of passed in terms of debates making the running mate pick the conventions. All
that stuff is past.""
Fundraising along with polling is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's
popularity and a campaign's strength. The money raised can be used ? among other things ? to hire
staff expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts pay to produce and run ads on TV
radio digital and mailers and for candidate travel.
""We're going to be outspent and that's going to lead to a better ground game for Harris"" a veteranRepublican operative who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely told Fox News.
But Brooks emphasized that ""the saving grace is that we have strong support among major donors
and big dollar donors going into the super PACs which you have to take into consideration.""

""I think you have to look at the totality of the pro-Trump money out there and I think the super PACs
help level the playing field significantly"" he added.

told Fox News Digital earlier this month ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats
always have a ton of money.""

for crucial electoral vote

President Kamala Harris or former President Trump wins the 2024 White House race suggests that
Harris holds a sizable lead.

Congressional District according to a new CNN poll conducted Sept. 20 to 25 and released on
Friday.

Trump succeeds President Biden in the White House.

White House victory and by 19 points in his 2020 re-election defeat.

its single electoral vote. In 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney won the district by single digits. Trumpnarrowly carried the district in 2016 but Biden won it four years ago.

highlighting the critical importance of a swing state that could decide the fate of November?s
election.

'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST
With the election just over four weeks away polling shows Michigan could be decided by a
razor-thin margin once again. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average as of Sunday
Harris currently holds a narrow 0.7 point edge in the state.
At the top of mind for voters in Michigan at both Trump and Harris rallies last week was immigration
with both sides agreeing that work needed to be done to secure the southern border. But while
Trump supporters mostly pin the blame on the Biden administration Harris supporters in Flintargued that it was Trump?s effort to kill President Biden?s bipartisan border legislation that was to
blame for the current situation.
""She has worked on a bill that she said that if she?s elected she?s going to sign into law that directly
puts more people on the front line that would actually be helping with the border while Trump shot
that down"" a voter told Fox News Digital.

""The Biden administration tried to put through an act that would make border crossings more limited

this down we can?t let them get a win?"" another voter said.
Meanwhile some voters argued that all Trump brings to the table on the issue is ""rhetoric"" that
divides people while Harris has the experience to solve the problem.

67,Conservative,FOX News,"Harris support for EVs could tank campaign in critical swing state
expert says
Vice President Kamala Harris? support for electric vehicles (EVs) could prove to be costly to her
chances in the critical swing state of Michigan.
""With Republicans beginning to embrace unions and labor we are seeing a dramatic shift in voting
behavior in Rust Belt States"" Jimmy Keady the founder and president of JLK Political Strategies
told Fox News Digital.
The comments come as the outlook for former President Donald Trump in Michigan has continued
to improve in recent weeks with Trump now holding a narrow lead of 0.9 points in the state
according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.
That lead represents a roughly three-point swing in the race since the end of August when Harris
held a 2.2-point lead over the former president according to the historic view of the polling average.
Michigan is rated a tossup state in the presidential race in the current Fox News Power Rankings.
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS LOSES HER LEAD AND A NEW ELECTORATE
EMERGES
Part of the reason for Trump?s recent surge in the state could be due to the support of working
class and union voters who worry that the push towards EVs could put many of them out of jobs in
the not-so-distant future.
""I think it is hurting Harris because of the Biden-Harris agenda on policies that don?t work for theworking class"" Michael Markey a former Republican Michigan Congressional candidate and
financial adviser told Fox News Digital.
The Trump campaign has leaned into the narrative releasing an ad earlier this month that warned
Michigan voters about Democratic support for EVs.
""Attention autoworkers: Kamala Harris wants to end all gas powered cars"" the ad said. ""Crazy but
true!""
Markey believes the message is hitting home for voters in Michigan arguing the issue is one reason
Trump and the GOP have gained ground in the state.

""It?s a slap in the face to the union workers"" he said. ""I think that?s why we?re seeing a lot of the
polling trending in Republicans favor right now.""
For her part Harris has attempted to push back against the narrative arguing at a rally in Flint
Michigan earlier this month that we would ""never"" mandate the ""kind of car you have to drive.""
Nevertheless Republicans have continued to hammer Harris both for her support of Biden
administration regulations on tailpipe emissions a push to phase-in EVs for newly built cars and
heavy subsidies for EV production in the United States. They have also pointed to Harris? plan
during her 2020 run for president to transition all new vehicles built in the U.S. to zero emissions by
2030.""They?re saying? ?no one?s going to force you or tell you what kind of car you can drive? but
they?re putting standards through the EPA that are basically mandating EV production"" Markey
said.
Markey argued that Michigan workers have a long history of being at the cutting edge of the
automotive industry and do not want to see jobs lost to a product that is neither profitable nor in
demand by consumers.

""The public is telling us what the next generation of cars is"" Markey said. ""They still want internal
combustion engines they want hybrids but EVs? that?s not where the public is.""
That could all add up to a problem in places like Michigan for Harris Keady argued noting the
Democratic candidate?s struggles with traditional blue voting blocs such as unions.
""The Teamsters refusal to endorse is sign number one that Harris is in trouble with union workers""
Keady said. ""It is not just the Biden-Harris administration?s manufacturing policies that are hurting
Michigan workers; their embrace of electric vehicle mandates will add an undue burden on
middle-class families.""

""It?s natural of course that you adapt your policies to meet the moment"" Pritzker said during an
appearance on CNN?s ""State of the Union"" Sunday.
The comments come as Harris has faced accusations of ""flip-flopping"" on several former policy

69,Conservative,FOX News,"Harris touts her work on the economy but what has she actually
done for small businesses?
As Election Day creeps closer Vice President Kamala Harris has sought to define herself as a
champion of small businesses which she has called ""the engines of our economy.""
However does the vice president's record match her rhetoric? Voters who rank the economy as
their top issue in this election do not seem to think so. The Harris-Walz campaign has lagged behind
rival former President Donald Trump who as of Oct. 1 held a nine percentage point lead over
Harris in trust on this issue according to the Fox News Power Rankings.
To undercut Trump Harris has proposed a wide range of policies to boost small businesses with an
ambitious goal of 25 million new business applications by the end of her first term should she be
elected president. She hopes to outpace the 15 million applications filed during Trump's first term.
Harris has pledged to give startup businesses a $50000 tax deduction and steer venture capital
toward local entrepreneurs in rural parts of the country to meet that goal.
""I believe America?s small businesses are an essential foundation to our entire economy"" Harris
said at a Sept. 4 rally in North Hampton New Hampshire where she outlined her vision for an
""opportunity economy.""
JAMES CARVILLE ADMITS HE'S ?SCARED TO DEATH? ABOUT ELECTION DAY
Her proposals include low and no-interest loans to small businesses simplifying how businesses
can file taxes increasing the number of federal contracts with small businesses and increasing
taxes on ""billionaires and big corporations"" to fund these programs. Harris' tax deduction plan has
won praise from some economists including Nicholas Creel an assistant professor of Business Lawat Georgia College and State University who called it ""potentially transformational.""
Creel told Fox News Digital her plan would help people ""justify the risky prospect of starting a new
business and making sure more of those new businesses survive.""
Other supporters point to Harris' work as vice president and senator to boost minority-owned
businesses in poorer communities.
""As Vice President Harris established the Economic Opportunity Coalition an unprecedented
public?private partnership that has poured billions of dollars of critical investment into historically
underserved communities. As Senator she secured a transformative $12 billion for Community
Development Financial Institutions and other community lenders providing capital to small
businesses around the country including to rural communities"" said Lindi Li a Democratic strategist
and member of the Harriz-Walz National Finance Committee.
Li's family owns commercial and residential real estate in Pennsylvania.
""My family and I run a small business ourselves and the Biden-Harris administration has been
incredibly supportive always extending a listening ear"" she told Fox News Digital.
?WE BELIEVE IN DONALD TRUMP?: MORE THAN A DOZEN MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS
ENDORSE FORMER PRESIDENT
Hundreds of venture capital investors have signed on to the Harris economic agenda as well.
""VP Harris' support for small businesses and startups is genuine and began long before thiscampaign"" said Gayle Jennings O'Byrne CEO of Wocstar Capital. ""I had the opportunity to speak
with her earlier this year when she came to North Carolina to announce $32 million in investments
into women and minority-led venture capital funds including mine. Over 825 of the nation?s top
venture capitalists myself included believe in her commitment so strongly that we publicly signed a
pledge titled ?VCs for Kamala.?""
Republicans are predictably far less optimistic about Harris' plans. Critics point to high inflation
under the Biden-Harris administration brought about by excessive government spending during the
COVID-19 pandemic as harmful for existing businesses.
""Vice President Kamala Harris has certainly positioned herself as an advocate for small businesses
with notable initiatives like increasing the startup tax deduction and focusing on underserved
communities. However the reality on the ground tells a more complicated story"" said Ryan Waite a
Republican political consultant.
Waite argued the Biden-Harris record has exacerbated inflationary pressures and undermines any
support for small businesses Harris aims to provide. Year-over-year price increases peaked at 9.1%
in June 2022 though inflation has since fallen to around 3% ? still above the Federal Reserve's
target 2% rate.
""Entrepreneurs need more than just access to capital. They need a stable economic foundation to
thrive. So far the administration has fallen short in addressing these immediate concerns and many
small businesses aren't seeing the benefits of these policies as quickly as VP Harris would have us
believe.""
The Harris-Walz campaign and White House did not respond to requests for comment.The Harris voting record
Harris' campaign website claims she was a strong advocate for small businesses as both a U.S.
senator and later as vice president. She was California's junior senator from 2017-2021 when
Trump occupied the White House during which time she opposed the GOP economic agenda.
Harris voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which slashed corporate taxes and
provided tax relief for small businesses with the Qualified Business Income Deduction in addition to
changes in individual tax deductions and the family tax credit which affects the economy overall.
As one of the more liberal members of the Senate Harris co-sponsored the Raise the Wage Act of
2019. Introduced by self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. the bill would
have increased the federal minimum wage to $15. Republicans opposed the effort arguing it would
increase costs on businesses that rely on low-skill or entry-level labor. It passed the House but died
in the Senate.
TRUMP HARRIS LOCKED IN DEAD HEAT IN 7 BATTLEGROUND STATES POLL FINDS:
?COULD NOT BE CLOSER?
On a more bipartisan note Harris voted for the CARES Act of 2020 a $2 trillion coronavirus relief
package that created the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan
initiatives to help small businesses survive COVID lockdown mandates. The final bill passed nearly
unanimously 96-0-4.
Later that year Harris secured passage of the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act which wasincluded in the COVID-related stimulus package passed in December 2020. The legislation provided
$12 billion to community development financial institutions (CDFIs) which direct capital to
businesses in minority and low- and moderate-income communities.
Harris also took several votes on amendments that impacted businesses. She voted for an
amendment that would extend and expand paid sick and paid family and medical leave mandates
on small businesses; against an amendment to ensure that supplemental unemployment insurance
compensation created in the CARES Act would not exceed employer compensation; and she
opposed the nomination of Linda McMahon to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration
in February 2017.
Outside of Congress Harris consistently supported ""Small Business Saturday"" during her time in the
Senate and she regularly visits small businesses while traveling and on the campaign trail.
Work in the Biden administration
As vice president Harris has mainly served as a spokeswoman and advocate for ""Bidenomics.""
However at a pivotal moments she has cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate to pass signature
legislation called for by President Biden.
In the early days of the administration Harris pushed through the American Rescue Plan a $1.9
trillion coronavirus aid package that built upon the CARES Act. She also campaigned on behalf of
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Though an infrastructure deal had evaded the Trump
administration the Biden-Harris law has since allocated nearly $454 billion in funding including over
56000 specific projects and awards across more than 4500 communities nationwide Forbes
reported.Again in August 2022 Harris was the tie-breaking vote in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
which extended tax credits for health care plans through the Affordable Care Act and implemented
additional tax credits to help small businesses save money on energy costs.
GOP lawmakers have criticized the IRA for ramping up government spending without significantly
reducing carbon emissions or inflation.
KAMALA HARRIS FEATURED ON COVER OF VOGUE IN GLOWING PROFILE: ?NATIONAL
RESCUE?
In support of the Biden administration's small business initiatives and building on her work in the
Senate Harris has led calls for the federal government to expand capital access to underserved
communities. The administration followed through by permitting new applications for Small Business
Lending Company licenses for the first time in 40 years ? which allows lending organizations to use
government guarantees when underwriting small business loans reducing risk to the lender and
effectively subsidizing costs to the borrower.
In 2022 Harris established the Economic Opportunity Coalition a group of financial institutions and
companies that joined together ""to address economic disparities and accelerate economic
opportunity in communities of color and other underserved communities."" Member institutions have
set a goal for $3 billion of investments into CDFIs and minority depository institutions which support
businesses in those communities.
The White House has placed a strong emphasis on supporting minority entrepreneurs and claims
statistics show its programs are working. ""Data from the Federal Reserve?s Survey of ConsumerFinances shows that between 2019 and 2022 the share of families owning a business increased by
9% with particularly large increases among Black and Hispanic households"" the White House has
said.
The administration has noted with approval that the percent of Black households owning a business
between 2019 and 2022 has more than doubled after falling between 2007 and 2019.

Trump gains
Vice President Harris is rolling out a new agenda that aims to boost financial and career prospects
for Black men.
The release of the Harris campaign's ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men"" on Monday comes just
four days after former President Obama in comments that went viral admonished Black male
voters for a lack of enthusiasm in support of Harris. Obama's comments came as polls indicate
former President Trump is making gains with Black men who are traditionally some of the
Democratic Party's most reliable supporters.
The Harris campaign with just over three weeks to go until Election Day hopes to spotlight its
agenda to help Black men achieve ""the opportunity to get ahead to thrive"" by equipping them ""with
the tools to achieve financial freedom lower costs to better provide for themselves and their
families and protect their rights.""
OBAMA STUMPING FOR HARRIS REPEATEDLY TAKES AIM AT TRUMP
The proposals include providing 1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and
others to start a business championing education training and mentorship programs that help Black
men get good-paying jobs in high-demand industries and lead their communities including
pathways to become teachers.
Also highlighted by the campaign is a regulatory framework to protect Black men's investments in
cryptocurrency and other digital assets a health equity initiative focused on Black men that
addresses sickle cell disease diabetes mental health prostate cancer and other health challengesthat disproportionately impact them and the creation of opportunities for Black Americans in the
recreational marijuana industry.
PRO-TRUMP BLACK GROUP FIRES BACK AT OBAMA
Former Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond a Harris campaign national co-chair said the new agenda
aims to make sure that ""Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home provide for
our families start a business and build wealth.""
""Donald Trump could care less about equipping hardworking Americans with the tools needed to get
ahead"" Richmond said. ""While Vice President Harris is promising to equip Black men with the tools
needed to pursue our dreams and aspirations Donald Trump is promising Black in America a
national nightmare.""
To help spread the message the Harris campaign said it is teaming up this week with Black male
celebrities influencers and activists in key battleground states this week for ""Black Men Huddle Up""
events. The campaign spotlights that it's also enlisting the support of influential entrepreneurs for
what it calls an ""Economic Freedom Talk"" series with Black business owners.
The new effort comes as Democrats are increasingly concerned about wavering support among
Black men and in particular younger Black men for Harris who would make history if she is elected
as the nation's first female president.

Harris and Trump are locked in a neck and neck race in the seven key battleground states whoserazor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and will likely
determine the winner of the 2024 White House race. Any erosion of support among Black voters
and in particular Black males could prove costly to the vice president.
Obama speaking Thursday at a Harris campaign office in Pittsburgh recollected the surge in
support among Black voters that boosted him toward history in 2008 to become the nation's first
Black president. He bluntly said he couldn't understand why Harris wasn't enjoying the same level of
enthusiasm noting that the hesitation was ""more pronounced with the brothers.""
""You?re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses"" Obama said. ""I?ve got a problem with
that.""
Speaking directly to Black males the former president said that ""part of it makes me think that well
you just aren?t feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you?re coming up with other
alternatives and other reasons for that.""
As expected Black supporters of Trump quickly rebuked the former president.
""President Obama?s recent call for Black men to support Kamala Harris based solely on her skin
color rather than her policies is deeply insulting"" the Black Men for Trump advisory board argued
this weekend.
But some Democrats also called out the former president for his remarks arguing that Obama
unfairly admonished Black men without striking a similar chord with other demographic groups that
have also expressed increased support for Trump.In another pitch to Black voters Harris on Tuesday heads to Detroit in battleground Michigan to sit

71,Conservative,FOX News,"Harris' off-putting manner put Zelenskyy on defensive ahead of
Russian invasion new book reveals
Vice President Kamala Harris? history as a federal prosecutor instilled in her a direct sometimes
adversarial communication style that reportedly alienated Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
during their first private sit-down leaving him ""disgruntled"" and defensive just days before Russian
troops invaded his country.
Their tense sit-down was chronicled in ""War"" the new book by Bob Woodward. In the book
Woodward details some of the most consequential foreign policy and security challenges overseen
by President Biden during his first term. Among them Russia?s 2022 invasion and ongoing war in
Ukraine.
Fox News obtained an early copy of the book which is available in bookstores today.
As Woodward reports Biden deployed Harris to the Munich Security Conference in February 2022
less than a week before Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops commenced their full-scale
invasion of Ukraine ? with the sole mission of convincing Zelenskyy that the Russian incursion was
imminent based on all available U.S. intelligence and the hundreds of thousands of troops it had
confirmed Russia had been amassing nearby including some 40000 soldiers near the Belarusian
border.
Harris was to demonstrate unified support for Ukraine from the U.S. and NATO and to help
Zelenskyy accept the fact that this was indeed happening.
However Woodward reports aspects of that mission backfired ? at least behind closed doors.Publicly Harris delivered a winning speech effectively reassuring the world of the U.S. commitment
to Ukraine's sovereignty and Article 5. It is considered among her major achievements as vice
president.
HUNTER BIDEN LEGAL SAGA IS ?REAL WAR? THAT 'PREOCCUPIED' OUTGOING
PRESIDENT NEW WOODWARD BOOK CLAIMS
In private however Zelenskyy was immediately put off by Harris?s brusque communication style
and ""forceful"" demeanor during their sit-down during which Harris and her national security adviser
Philip Gordon wore masks and did not attempt to shake hands with their Ukrainian counterparts
upon entering the room.
Though Germany was still under COVID-19 protocols the icy start to the meeting ""disgruntled""
Zelenskyy Woodward said and left the Ukrainian president feeling ""like he was about to be
reprimanded"" at a frightening and vulnerable time for his nation.
""You need to take seriously the likelihood that any day the Russians will invade your country"" Harris
told him forcefully.
In Woodward's telling things between the two did not improve from there.
Harris a successful former federal prosecutor and California attorney general has been praised and
criticized for her adversarial communication style ? and it was one she reportedly employed during
her sit-down with Zelenskyy in attempt to convince him of the imminence of Russia's invasion.
TRUMP MEETS UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY AT TRUMP TOWER SAYS RUSSIA'S WAR MUSTEND WITH 'FAIR DEAL'
""Look"" Harris told him after some tense back-and-forth ""our teams will share more specific
information with you but we are telling you that your numbers are wrong. You really face a
potentially imminent invasion.""
Rather than softening him the meeting appeared to put Ukraine's president even more on the
defensive.
As Woodward writes Zelenskyy was hard-pressed to acknowledge the imminence of the invasion
despite credible U.S. intelligence in large part because it would create a ""self-fulling prophecy"" for
Ukraine's nascent democracy risking the collapse of the country's economy and potentially its
government.
Finally Zelenskyy relented looking Harris in the eye and asking directly ""What do you want me to
do?""
He inquired whether the U.S. would impose sanctions close ports to Russian ships give Ukraine
Stinger or Javelin missiles or send warplanes to his country in order to equip them for the battles
ahead.
Harris?s answer did little to assuage him. ""The punishment can only come after the crime"" she said
of a U.S. response to Russia Woodward noted instead advising him to ""start thinking about things
like having a succession plan in place to run the country if you're captured or killed or cannot
govern.""Zelenskyy was urged by the U.S. to have an escape plan ? one which he boldly rebuffed choosing
to remain in Kyiv in the days and weeks following Russia?s invasion.
He also turned down evacuation offers from both the U.S. and Turkey following the start of the war.
The ""fight is here"" he would later say from Kyiv. ""I need ammunition not a ride.""

Republicans in Michigan are attempting to capitalize on Vice President Kamala Harris? struggles

up with the Real Clear Politics polling average showing Harris with just a slim 0.5 point lead in the
state with just under four weeks to go before the election.
Republicans have hit the state repeatedly in recent weeks with both Trump and his running mate
Ohio Sen. JD Vance making several appearances in the state.
KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT
WAS THEIR REASONING?'
Those appearances come as Michigan Democrats have begun to worry about the vice president?s
prospects in the state with some imploring her to visit the state more frequently as the race hits the
home stretch.According to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday prominent Michigan Democrats
including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have made appeals to the Harris campaign to focus on the state
more as the election draws to a close. They have also warned Harris to sharpen her economic
messaging the report notes with fears spreading that Trump has done well to court the state?s
working class voters.
Harris has struggled to distance herself from past positions that remain unpopular in the so-called
""Blue Wall"" states of Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin including her previous support for
transitioning fully to zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and a ban on fracking.
Those concerns were also highlighted by an internal poll shared with The Wall Street Journal that
was conducted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin?s D-Wis. campaign that showed Harris down by three
points in Wisconsin another key Midwestern state with similar voting habits to Michigan.

National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital
that Harris? message does not ""resonate with working class voters"" such as those in the upper
Midwest something that could also help down-ballot Republicans in the critical swing states.Harris? struggles have also extended to union members a group that has long been a stronghold
for Democrats in the state. However an internal poll conducted by Teamsters one of the country?s
largest and most influential unions found that members in Michigan preferred Trump (61.7%) over
Harris (35.2%) while national union leaders declined to make an endorsement in this year?s
presidential race despite supporting President Biden?s campaign in 2020.

supported Biden in 2020 though she did gain the support of both United Auto Workers and the

""People talk this way when they have absolutely nothing substantive to say because they know next

""Shocking"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.
Comedian Tim Young commented ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after
we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if
she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""
""This is the real Kamala. And she?s no friend of Israel"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.
New York Rep. Elise Stefanik wrote ""Israel is taking out Iranian-backed terrorists across the Middle
East making the world safer for Israel and the United States yet Kamala Harris refuses to say that
Prime Minister Netanyahu is a strong ally to America. Kamala Harris is unfit to be the President of
the United States.""

Whitaker asked ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
""I think with all due respect the better question is do we have an important alliance between the

74,Conservative,FOX News,"Heightened 'significance and importance' as Vance Walz face-off in
VP debate
NEW YORK CITY ? With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris
and former President Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error race with five weeks until Election
Day in November - there's a lot on the line in the vice presidential debate.
While debates between the running mates are the undercard of a White House race and have rarely
moved the need much in the past when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of
Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz the Democrats' nominee face-off on Tuesday there will be
heightened stakes.
Any major knockout blow - or agonizing misstep - could turn what's traditionally seen as a
second-tier event into an impactful showdown.
""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head matchup between the principal candidates
and this is the last meet up between the two tickets directly before the election it heightens the
importance and significance of this debate"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan
Williams a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns told Fox News.
THE WHO WHAT WHERE AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
Most political pundits said that Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate.
And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.
So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION
And there's a precedent from twelve years ago.
After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee
Mitt Romney then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate
debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.
Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative
sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.
Walz who is 60 has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.
The governor has been in debate camp ahead of the showdown to prepare. Walz huddled with
advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock
debates - in Harbor Springs Michigan near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.
Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz.
Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate
preparation Walz told reporters ""she wins every one.""
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW
A source familiar with Vance's debate prep tells Fox News Digital that over the last month thesenator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team where a group of people who
ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult
examination or test or in Vance's case a vice presidential debate.
According to the source Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week with Rep. Tom
Emmer of Minnesota the House majority whip playing the role of Walz. Former Trump
administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of
the moderators from CBS News which is hosting the debate in New York City.
Halfway through the mock debate the power went out as a strong storm slammed through the
vicinity of Cincinnati Ohio where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according
to the source who shared the details first with Fox News Vance and the team continued on using
lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.
Emmer and Walz overlapped for four years in the House before Walz won election in 2018 as
Minnesota's governor. ""I do know him probably as well or better than most on the Republican side""
he said.
And Emmer taking a shot at his fellow Minnesotan argued ""the hardest part of playing Walz? is
trying to tell lies with a straight face because that?s what he does. He?s good at the debate game
but there isn?t substance there. There?s a lot of air.""
Former President Trump asked Monday if he had given his running mate any advice told reporters
""No he doesn't need it.""
But he added that he and Vance had ""been speaking a little bit back and forth"" and that he thoughtthe senator was in ""good shape.""
Part of the Harris campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.
For weeks they've painted Walz as a regular guy who will be facing off with the Ivy League-trained
Vance. What they don't mention is that Walz won six House races and two gubernatorial elections.
The Trump campaign's playing the same game.
""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good.
He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night"" Trump
campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.
But Trump seemed to undercut this campaign's argument charging in an interview with Kellyanne
Conway's Fox Nation program ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne"" that Vance is ""going up against a
moron. A total moron how she picked him is unbelievable.""
Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.
According to the latest Fox News national poll Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable
rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.
Vance stood in negative territory at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe senator arrived in New York City on Monday afternoon and in the evening took a break from
debate preparations to headline a gathering of GOP mega donors.
Walz was scheduled to fly to New York City on Tuesday ahead of the debate.
The vice presidential debate is being moderated by ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing
editor Norah O?Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" host and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret
Brennan.
The 90-minute debate which kicks off at 9pm ET will take place at the CBS News broadcast center
in New York City.
The Fox News Channel FOX Business Network Fox News Digital Fox News Audio and Fox Nation
will air special programming of the debate.
Both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to two four-minute commercial breaks during the
debate. Campaign staff are not allowed to interact with the candidates during those breaks.
The other rules - including no studio audience - are similar to September's Harris-Trump debate and
June's debate between Trump and President Biden.
But there is one major difference - a candidate's microphone won't be muted when the opponent is
speaking.","FOX News_Heightened__significance_and_importance__as_Vance,.pdf.pdf",news_articles
75,Conservative,FOX News,"Hurricane-hit battleground states face additional voting hurdles in
run-up to Election Day
Voters in storm-ravaged parts of the Southeast could face new hurdles at the ballot box this year
following the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Helene and Milton back-to-back disasters that have
sparked a flurry of new outreach from states parties and even campaigns themselves in a bid to
expand voters' access to the polls and ensure their votes are counted.
Though the efforts in the hurricane-hit southern states have taken very different shapes the shared
goal is to increase engagement and participation in the 2024 presidential race in which candidates
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remain locked in a virtual dead heat with less than a month until
Election Day.
In North Carolina efforts have been focused on helping displaced residents access polling locations
in the wake of Hurricane Helene which barreled onto shore last month as a Category 4 storm killing
more than 220 people and causing billions of dollars in destruction.
The bulk of the storm's destruction was concentrated in western North Carolina and in Georgia two
competitive states that could play a key role in determining the next president. Roughly 17% of
North Carolina?s registered voters reside in the counties that were designated as disaster areas in
the aftermath of Helene Michael Bitzer a professor of politics and history at Catawba College
previously told Fox News.
'CAN'T WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE': NC CONGRESSMAN RAISES ALARM ON VOTER
ACCESS IN AREAS HARD HIT BY HELENE
To that end the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted last week to approve changes for 13counties in the region whose access to infrastructure polling locations and postal services is
believed to remain ""severely disrupted"" through Election Day. State election officials also announced
coordination with FEMA and North Carolina Emergency Management to set up portable restrooms
generators and trailers to support the more than 500 polling places in the state's western region ?
and an area of devastation that spans some 25 counties.
Meanwhile the Trump campaign also hinted at new efforts to help transport voters to the ballot
boxes in hurricane-hit states. Speaking to Fox News in an interview Monday Trump campaign press
secretary Karoline Leavitt said the campaign has been in contact with state and local election
officials in the Southeast to survey the damage and ensure voters have access to the ballots.
The campaign leadership she said ""has sent a letter ""to state and local officials on the ground in
North Carolina saying ?You need to provide as many accessible voting locations as possible on the
ground'"" Leavitt told Fox News adding: ""Our campaign is reviewing how we can possibly provide
transportation for voters who need to get to the polls and ensuring they have access to the ballot
box.""
In Florida which was battered by both Hurricanes Helene and Milton Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an
executive order granting election officials in hard-hit counties additional flexibility to alter their
election procedures ? including polling locations and requests for mail-in ballot addresses to be
changed at the last minute.
Meanwhile Democrats suffered a blow in Georgia last week after a federal judge ruled that she will
not order the state to reopen its voter registration process or extend its voter registration deadline in
the aftermath of Hurricane Helene rejecting arguments from the Georgia conference of the NAACP
the Georgia Coalition of the People's Agenda and the New Georgia Project which said disruptionsfrom the storm had unfairly deprived them of their right to register.
The ruling could have a major impact in Georgia a key battleground state that narrowly selected
Biden by just 12000 votes in 2020. (A federal judge in Florida also rejected a similar request
brought in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton filed by the Florida chapter of the League of
Women Voters.)
Federal judges in both states claimed that voters had ample time to register for the November
election.

76,Conservative,FOX News,"If 2024 polling errors mirror those in 2020 election Trump 'wins in a
blowout' CNN data guru says
CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that if the 2024 presidential election polls are as
off as they were in 2020 former President Trump ""wins in a blowout.""
Enten broke down current swing state polling numbers between Vice President Kamala Harris and
Trump noting that they show a race ""too close to call."" However he pointed out that polls have
been off significantly in recent elections and if that?s the case this time Trump could win by a
landslide.
""But let?s say we have a polling miss like we had in 2020"" Enten told CNN anchor John Berman.
""What happens then? Well then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral
votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states plus Nevada plus the other
states he was leading in ? Arizona North Carolina and Georgia"" he said.
CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH ?UNDERPERFORMANCE? FROM
YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT
The reporter began by displaying the close race numbers between Trump and Harris in the seven
battleground states. As his aggregate polls showed Harris is up by one point in Nevada and
Pennsylvania and up by two in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump on the other hand is up by one in
North Carolina and Georgia and two points up in Arizona.
Enten reminded viewers that these point differences are within the polling margin of error according
to FiveThirtyEight so currently it?s impossible to know who is winning.He mentioned that on average since 1972 ? provided that presidential candidates are polling within
ten points of one another ­? swing state polls have an error rate of 3.4 points so there is room for
the actual race to swing in Harris? or Trump?s favor when they?re within one or two points of each
other.
He further noted that in 5% of cases swing state polling can be off by 9.4 points making things
even less certain for people looking at the polls right now.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE
""So the bottom line is the state polling averages tell us- what it tells us is it?s just a race that is too
close to call. Maybe one candidate has an advantage over the other one. But the bottom line is it is
way too close to call and it will remain so"" he said.
Still Enten offered multiple hypothetical situations the first one being what the election results
would look like if the current swing state polling is 100% accurate. ""If the polls are exactly right
Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump?s 262 because she carries those Great
Lake battleground states despite losing North Carolina Georgia and Arizona.""
He then followed up by showing what would happen if polling errors matched those found in the
2020 election. According to Vanderbilt University polls overstated President Biden?s lead over
Trump by 3.9 percentage in the two weeks prior to election day calling it the ""largest polling error
since 1980 when support for Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was overestimated by 6 percentage
points.""Enten argued if today?s polls had the similar errors of the last cycle Trump could walk away with
312 electoral college votes to Harris? 226.
Conversely Enten discussed what would happen if polling errors predicting a red wave in the 2022
midterm elections appeared on Nov. 5 2024.
""What happens if we have a polling miss like 2022?"" he asked. ""Well in that particular case now
the winner has flipped again. And Kamala Harris wins in a blowout with 319 electoral votes because
she retakes those Great Lake battleground states carries North Carolina Georgia and Arizona.""",FOX News_If_2024_polling_errors_mirror_those_in_2020_electi.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Janet Jackson's Sunday apology for recent comments about Vice President Kamala Harris was

In an interview with the Guardian on Saturday the 58-year-old singer was asked about her thoughts
on Harris potentially becoming the first Black female president.
""Well you know what they supposedly said?"" Jackson said. ""She?s not Black. That?s what I heard.
That she?s Indian.""
When the interviewer argued Harris was both Black and Indian Jackson continued ""Her father?s
White. That?s what I was told. I mean I haven?t watched the news in a few days. I was told that
they discovered her father was White.""
BLACK PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS SAY KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T BLACK IN VIRAL CNN CLIP: 'TO

Buzzfeed reported that Jackson's manager Mo Elmasri released a statement on Sunday saying her
comments were ""based on misinformation"" rather than her actual thoughts on Harris.
""She deeply respects Vice President Kamala Harris and her accomplishments as a Black and Indian
woman"" the statement said. ""Janet apologizes for any confusion caused and acknowledges the
importance of accurate representation in public discourse.""
""We appreciate the opportunity to address this and will remain committed to promoting unity"" thestatement concluded.
However other reports have disputed the statement from Elmarsi claiming he doesn't manage
Harris and that the singer is managed by her brother Randy Jackson. Variety reported ""after a
confusing turn of events on Sunday reps for Janet Jackson tell Variety that an unusually worded
?apology? for the singer?s ill-informed comments about Democratic presidential candidate Kamala

claimed and thus was not authorized to speak on her behalf.""
According to IMBD Elmarsi works as a ""creative consultant"" for Jackson Beyoncé Britney Spears
and Selena Gomez and he is listed as a producer for the TV series ""Janet Jackson: Family First.""
In the Guardian interview Jackson also gave her opinion on whether she believed the country was
ready for a ""woman of color"" president.
""I don?t know"" Jackson said. ""Honestly I don?t want to answer that because I really truthfully
don?t know. I think either way it goes is going to be mayhem.""

said Harris changed her racial background.""She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage"" Trump said. ""I

NOT ON THE BALLOT'
She continued ""I for example am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in
Washington D.C. I invite ideas whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me who
were just on stage with me minutes ago and the business sector and others who can contribute to
the decisions that I make.""
BIDEN SAYS HARRIS HANDLED 'EVERYTHING FROM FOREIGN POLICY TO DOMESTIC
POLICY' UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATIONBaier followed up ""We?ve heard a lot about those plans in recent days. Your campaign slogan is ?a
new way forward? and ?it?s time to turn the page.? You have been vice president for three and a
half years so what are you turning the page from?""
""First of all turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of
rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country
and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that
suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know
the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up"" Harris said.
Baier attempted to interject but Harris continued ""The strength of an American president which is
one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us.""
She emphasized ""That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of
Bret. People are exhausted.""
VP KAMALA HARRIS RESPONDS TO WHY MORE AMERICANS TRUST TRUMP ON THE
ECONOMY
Baier asked why after 3 and a half years of the Biden-Harris administration 79% of people say the
country is on the wrong track. ""If you're turning the page you've been in office for three and a half
years"" he prompted.
""And Donald Trump has been running for office since-"" Harris replied as Baier again noted she had
been in office.""Come on"" she said. ""You and I both know what I'm talking about.""
""I actually don't what are you talking about?"" he asked before Harris pivoted again to Trump.
Harris similarly dodged questions about her immigration record to turn the issue to Trump.
Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a statement following Harris'
interview with Baier calling the sit-down a ""train wreck"" and that Harris ""couldn?t give a straight
answer to a single question because she has no answers. Kamala?s entire campaign is based on
lies about President Trump. Kamala can?t handle the pressure of an interview with Fox News ? she
certainly can?t handle the pressure of being President of the United States.""

86,Conservative,FOX News,"Kamala Harris claims she supports small business. She doesn't and I
have the receipts
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
In an attempt to distance herself from the economic ruin she had a hand in creating Vice President
Kamala Harris is positioning herself as the small business candidate. That?s a good strategy given
that there are more than 33 million small businesses in the United States and tens of millions more
if you include entrepreneurial gig workers.
But one cannot just wave a magic wand and become something. Between the Biden-Harris policies
over the last three and three-quarters years as well as her campaign proposals it is clear that
Harris is in actuality the anti-small business candidate.
While it is always challenging to be an entrepreneur small business owners have had a particularly
rough go over the last five years. They bore the brunt of the COVID-19 shutdown mandates while
they saw big businesses get more support and thrive.
HARRIS' STRUGGLES WITH MICHIGAN'S WORKING CLASS VOTERS PROVIDES OPENING
FOR TRUMP GOP
Coming out of COVID the Biden-Harris policies helped to stoke historic inflation which created an
immense set of challenges for small business owners (as well as Main Street Americans).
It is estimated that the Biden-Harris administration increased the regulatory burden on small
businesses to the tune of $1.7 trillion costing small businesses more than 300 million hours of
compliance time.This may be why the NFIB (National Federation of Independent Business) which puts out a monthly
small business optimism survey has seen that index stay below its 50-year historic average for 33
consecutive months.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Another small business blow comes from Harris?s stance on independent work. In 2021 the
Biden-Harris administration overturned a Trump-era independent contractor rule and in 2024 the
Biden-Harris Department of Labor put in place alternate restrictive standards for contractor work.
This matters to not only those entrepreneurs who want to work flexibly but also to small businesses
that rely on contractors.
Harris has also been clear that she is a supporter of the PRO Act which includes much of the anti-
independent contractor language from California?s AB 5 rule which aims to take away work
flexibility on the national level.
Harris?s flagship proposal purportedly demonstrating her support of small business rests on
increasing a startup expense credit. Not only is this proposal opaque but it is also focused solely on
new business entities and completely ignores America?s more than 33 million existing small
businesses.
Her other proposals are directly damaging to small business owners. She has communicated that
she will let the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire which gave many small businesses a tax break and
included a qualified business income deduction for certain small businesses that will also expire.
She has also said she plans to raise income tax and capital gains taxes among other proposalsthat will see existing small businesses paying more of their hard-earned money to the government.

In terms of legislation like the Corporate Transparency Act Beneficial Ownership Information (CTA
BOI) rule that targets small businesses as financial criminals Harris has shown no solidarity with
small business owners. There is a CTA BOI delay bill stuck in the Senate as well as another delay
and two repeal bills proposed in Congress and she could lend a pro-small business voice to these
efforts if that were actually her priority.
Small businesses are the backbone of the economy and they deserve to be treated with respect
not used as a political pawn. Kamala Harris?s actions are very clear no matter what she says she
is no friend to small business.",FOX News_Kamala_Harris_claims_she_supports_small_business._.pdf.pdf,news_articles
87,Conservative,FOX News,"Kamala Harris courts disillusioned Arab Americans over Jewish
groups records show
Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters
who were dejected by President Joe Biden?s handling of war in the Middle East over courting the
Jewish voter.
That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the
Democratic nominee for president.
Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint Michigan on Friday.
That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement which has
declined to endorse her in Michigan in July.
Her public schedule hasn?t included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July after she declined to preside over his joint address to
Congress.
In August her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community and on
Aug. 15 Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September she
called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox
News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.
Wa?el Alzayat the CEO of Emgage Action told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday
""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""
The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on thismatter with the current administration policies which we don?t agree with.""
HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A ?CLOSE ALLY? ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7
Michigan which Biden narrowly won in 2020 is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the
second-highest population of Arab American residents who make up around 3% of its population.
On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks former President Donald Trump will speak to
Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to
journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President?s Residence in honor
of those killed a year ago.
One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza Israel is now entrenched in war on other
fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to
fight Hezbollah and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv ? though most were intercepted ?
from Iran.
Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic ? in 2020 Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.
Harris? focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the
community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.
Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats ? but new polling suggests that could change. Of
likely voters in the community Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42% according to
new polling by the Arab American Institute.Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan and his former director of national
intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump?s father-in-law Massad Boulos a Lebanese
American businessman have been leading his outreach to the community.
HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY ?SWAY? OVER NETANYAHU
""His outreach now is much better much different than it was in 2016 and 2020"" Adel Ayoub leader
of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told Fox News Digital of Trump.
Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020 but support from that community has cratered
since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 2023.
The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted
ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats and more than a million did so.

men: 'Not my experience'
Vice President Kamala Harris pushed back on polls showing she was losing support from Black
men in a new interview.
During a 23-minute sit-down with Black-focused entertainment outlet ""The Shade Room"" on
Monday Harris was asked about polls indicating that the Democrats' advantage with Black voters
may be declining from past presidential cycles and among Black men in particular.
According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Saturday Harris currently holds 78%
of the Black vote which is down from 2020 when President Biden won approximately 90% of that
voting bloc. It's also down from 2016 when Hillary Clinton won approximately 92% of the Black vote.
Harris' support among Black men has dropped even more significantly according to the report: 70%
said they would vote for Harris in November down from Biden?s 85% in 2020.
""When you hear those numbers and you're seeing in the polls ? Black men aren't as excited or fired

support.
""Black men are no different from anybody else. They expect that you have to earn their vote. And
that's why I'm out here"" she continued.
""It's incumbent on me to earn their support that?s why I?m talking to folks about the work I?ve done

continue to do so if elected as president.

enthusiasm for the female presidential candidate.
""I'm very proud to have his support"" Harris said before urging listeners to take heed to Obama's
warning about what's at stake in this election if her opponent former President Trump were to be

interviews: 'She owes us these answers'
Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for avoiding specifics and dodging questions in the
wake of multiple interviews she's done this week as media pundits demand she actually answer
questions from the press.
""This week she couldn?t or wouldn?t answer a single question straight and people could see it. She
is an artless dodger"" The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan wrote suggesting voters now have a
choice between ""awful and empty.""
Harris spoke to journalists this week during an interview with the National Association of Black
Journalists (NAJB) and sat down with Oprah Winfrey who endorsed her for president at the DNC.
Harris has yet to hold a formal press conference since emerging as the nominee.
""She owes us these answers. It is wrong that she can?t or won?t address them. It is disrespectful to
the electorate"" Noonan wrote arguing that avoiding questions on illegal immigration was ""political
malpractice.""
HARRIS ADVISER BRUSHES OFF LACK OF INTERVIEWS: ?SHE?S A VERY BUSY PERSON'
The New York Times' Todd Purdum a former White House correspondent for the outlet wrote on
Thursday that Harris could not afford to be vague.
""In a campaign in which Donald Trump fills our days with arrant nonsense and dominates the
national discussion (and polls show a tight race where Ms. Harris is running behind Joe Biden?s
level of support in 2020 with some groups) the vice president can?t afford to stick only to rehearsedanswers and stump speeches that might not persuade voters or shape what America is talking
about"" Purdum said.
Purdum suggested that direct answers from the vice president would go a long way with voters.
""Writing about politicians for decades has convinced me that direct succinct answers and
explanations from Ms. Harris would go a long way ? perhaps longer than she realizes ? toward
persuading voters that they know enough about her and her plans"" the journalist wrote.
CNN COMMENTATOR SLAMS HARRIS AFTER OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN: 'WHEN HAS SHE
SAT DOWN WITH ANY HOSTILE MEDIA?'
MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have suggested the
opposite arguing that Harris didn't need to be specific about her policies.
Clinton argued that she had more policy than anyone when she ran against Trump in 2016.
""I gave speeches about it. It was on our website. I wrote a book with Tim Kaine about it. We had lots
of policy. At the end of the day that?s not what caused people to vote for me or against me and I
think the Harris campaign knows that. They know that you?ve got to you know cross a threshold
which they have more than done in terms of what kind of governance you?re promising"" Clinton
said during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""
Ruhle suggested Harris didn't need to be specific because she was running against Trump.
""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump. We have two choices. Andso there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024 unlike 2016 for a lot of the
American people we know exactly what Trump will do who he is and the kind of threat he is to
democracy"" Ruhle insisted during an appearance on Bill Maher's show.

Bret Stephens an anti-Trump New York Times columnist who has also called on Harris to answer
questions more directly told Ruhle ""I don't think it's a lot to ask for her to sit down for a real
interview as opposed to a puff piece in which she describes her feelings of growing up in Oakland
with nice lawns.""
Stephens called on Harris to answer more difficult questions in a recent NYT column.
""It should not be hard for Harris to demonstrate that she can give detailed answers to urgent policy
questions. Or to express a sense beyond a few canned phrases of how she sees the American
interest in a darkening world. Or to articulate a politics of genuine inclusion that reaches out to tens
of millions of distrustful voters. Or to prove that she?s more than another factory-settings liberal
Democrat whose greatest virtue like her greatest fault is that she won?t step too far from the
conventional wisdom"" he wrote.
Some reports and pundits suggested Harris ""lacked specifics"" and stuck to her script during the
NABJ interview.
ABC's Selina Wang said Harris ""did not directly answer the question or offer any policy specifics""
referring to a question about the Israel-Hamas war.""There were multiple times though during this interview where Vice President Harris did not offer a
specific answer. Instead she pivoted and returned to her talking points that she wanted to hit""

off than they were four years ago.

do to clean up a mess. As of today we have created over 16 million new jobs over 800000 new
manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations"" Harris said
during the interview.
Phillip argued that Harris should have something ""quick"" and ""understandable"" ready in response to

immigration record in Fox News interview
Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly dodged several questions about her administration's
immigration record and instead pivot to former President Trump during an interview with Fox News'
Bret Baier.
Baier began the interview Wednesday by asking Harris how many illegal immigrants were released
by the Biden administration into the country.
""Well I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you"" Harris responded. ""It
is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have. And you know what I'm going to talk about-""
""But just a number"" Baier pressed. ""Do you think it's 1 million? 3 million?""

""So looking back do you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your
administration?"" Baier asked.Harris responded by highlighting the Biden administration's first legislative push which was

during the Biden administration.
""This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country""
Baier said. ""So what I'm saying to you do you owe those families an apology?""
""Let me just say- first of all those are tragic cases. There's no question about that. There's no
question about that"" Harris said. ""And I can't imagine the pain that the families of those victims have
experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if [the border
security bill] had actually been passed nine months ago it would be nine months that we would
have had more border agents at the border more support for the folks who are working around the
clock trying to hold it all together to ensure that no future harm would occur.""

DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN
""Madam Vice President it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration"" Baier later
pressed before turning to testimony from Jocelyn Nungaray's mother who said the Biden-Harrisadministration was responsible for her daughter's murder.
""So do you owe them an apology is what I'm saying"" Baier again asked.
""I will tell you that I'm so sorry for her loss. I'm so sorry for her loss. Sincerely. But let's talk about
what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions"" Harris
responded. ""Let's talk about that as well. In all fairness I told you I feel awful for what she and her
family have experienced.""

""You said repeatedly that the border was secure when in your mind did it start becoming a crisis?""
Baier then asked.
""We've had a broken immigration system transcending by the way Donald Trump's administration
even before. Let's all be honest about that"" Harris said. ""I have no pride in saying that this is a
perfect immigration system. I've been clear. I think we all know that it needs to be fixed. We need
more- I was just down at the border talking with border agents? we need more judges. We need to
process those cases faster. We need the support for cases that should be prosecuted. They need
more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that's going to get fixed Bret. That's
how this system works.""

immigrants who are in custody Harris pivoted to Trump.
""I will follow a law. A law that Donald Trump actually followed. You're probably familiar with now it'sa public report that under Donald Trump's administration these surgeries were available to on a

Harris will make appearances with ABC's ""The View"" radio star Howard Stern and CBS late-night
comic Stephen Colbert all hosts of extremely friendly venues for the Democratic candidate who
have repeatedly railed against her opponent.
The co-hosts of ""The View"" a talk-show under ABC's news division have repeatedly expressed
support for Harris and devote segments on an almost daily basis to attacking former President
Trump as a threat to democracy.
The co-hosts quickly got behind the vice president in September in their season premiere after
President Biden dropped out of the race and praised her ""flawless"" campaign.
ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT: STUDY
Harris did an about-face on multiple far-left policies she openly supported when she ran for
president in 2020 including on fracking the Green New Deal and on getting rid of private health
insurance. Liberal co-host Sunny Hostin argued in early September that the vice president had
always been ""moderate.""
""People evolve and grow"" Whoopi Goldberg said dismissing Harris' flip-flops during the discussion.
""The difference perhaps now is that someone has actually admitted it.""Co-host Joy Behar even recently demanded Republicans vote Democrat to ""save the country.""

liberal hosts in criticizing the former president as an existential threat to the nation. Navarro even
hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention in August.

""For me to have the chance to stand on that stage and help my girl Kamala make history and

Griffin has not emphatically endorsed the vice president but plans to headline an anti-Trump event
in Pennsylvania alongside other anti-Trump Republicans such as Liz Cheney who has endorsed
Harris.
Navarro touted the Harris interview on ""The View"" and said her Tuesday media blitz was evidence
the vice president was facing tough questions. CNN's Brian Stelter also suggested on Monday that
the co-hosts of ""The View"" would have ""sharp"" questions for Harris on Tuesday.
Late-night comedy has become a hotbed for Democratic Party support in recent years but Colbert
has taken it to another level with his fawning monologues and interviews in recent years.
Colbert hosted a fundraiser alongside Barack Obama Bill Clinton and President Biden in March
prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The star-studded Democratic fundraiser brought in over $25
million for Biden's campaign. In 2020 he popped champagne on the air over Biden and Harriswinning the election.

you I have no respect for you"" Stern said during one of his shows in September.
The blitz this week follows a ""60 Minutes"" appearance and an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy""
podcast. Media analysts said Harris' approach of doing more softball interviews made sense given
some of her shortcomings.
""Harris tends not to communicate effectively whether it?s her long-winded non-answer answers or
her demeanor so for her it does make more sense to appear in friendly venues"" said
communications expert Tobe Berkovitz a Professor Emeritus at Boston University.Even Harris' other interviews before Tuesday have skewed toward being friendly such as with
MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. Lesley Lopez a public affairs professional and assistant professor at
George Washington University dismissed the idea that Harris was erring by avoiding difficult
interviews.
""One man's so-called bubble campaign is another's strategic earned media plan. I think her

told Fox News Digital.
Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany who is now a Fox News host said the trio

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President
Kamala Harris there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a
made-up media story I saw it but with less than a month to go the joy is gone and a quiet panic is
setting in.
In the first week of August I was appropriately enough in Harrisburg Pennsylvania and Democrats
I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of
calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.
Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn?t love how Biden had been shown the door but that
they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month it sure
looked that way.
5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW
In San Francisco most voters I spoke to red and blue alike felt like Harris was likely to win that the
Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA gotten a jump and was back on the road.
Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and
much like a new restaurant opening in a small town voters were eager to give her a try.
While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional
interviews or hold so much as one press conference her arrogant advisers smirked and saidbasically ""So what? She?s winning.""
Well she?s not winning anymore and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this
week showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.
Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America?s influence with our Middle East ally
Israel the veep once again proved herself to be a walking talking salad bar here is what she had to
say:
""Well Bill the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were
very much prompted by or a result of many things including our advocacy for what needs to
happen in the region.""
KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW'
STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN
The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying ""we?re
trying"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.
Over the past two weeks in my travels it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about
the presidential race much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is
avoiding the sports page they just don?t want to talk about it.
As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it ""I don?t know she?s just kind of
there.""It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny when joy gave way to
frustration but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her and the massive union?s internal polling
showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

It was only after that that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back
in August namely ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.
Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference something he is at least still capable of
quipping ""I?m back in.""
Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge they insist she
still leads in the polling averages she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox and a ground
game that Trump can only envy.
These points are all true and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf
and not grassroots much like her crowning as the nominee but those busloads of supporters in
matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.
But still there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today ""60 Minutes""
wasn?t it and her appearances on podcasts late night shows and ""The View"" make her look likeshe is pitching a new rom-com not running for president of the United States.
The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the
joy is gone and it is the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage against the dying of the
light.

Israeli PM Netanyahu
Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the Biden administration had
influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war in the Middle East continues.
CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course""
despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no
sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.
""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that
were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat
that Hamas Hezbollah presents Iran I think that it is without any question our imperative to do
what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now the work we do
diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles
which include the need for humanitarian aid the need for this war to end the need for a deal to be
done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire. And we?re not going to stop in
terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region including Arab leaders"" Harris responded.
Whitaker responded and said it seemed like Netanyahu was not listening.

needs to happen in region"" Harris responded.Whitaker asked again ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""
""I think with all due respect the better question is do we have an important alliance between the
American people and the Israeli people and the answer to that question is yes"" Harris responded.

election surprise
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
Which is more important: having Oprah Winfrey in your corner or the nation?s largest police union?
Taylor Swift or steamfitters? Meryl Streep or the majority of Teamsters?
Democrats continue to pretend they represent working-class Americans but polling tells a different
story. When 60% of rank-and-file Teamsters support Donald Trump compared to only 34% backing
Kamala Harris something profound has shifted. Since Trump emerged as a candidate in 2016 and
spoke to the concerns of blue-collar America we have seen a realignment of party allegiances that
terrifies Democrats. Without middle class voters they will not win the swing states and they will not
win the White House.
Kamala Harris hopes to reverse her campaign?s seepage of working-class voters by hosting gaudy
events like the one she just did with Oprah Winfrey but headliners like ""Pretty Woman"" Julia
Roberts who joined in Oprah?s virtual town hall probably won?t move the needle.
TIKTOK CREATOR ROASTS OPRAH HARRIS FOR FEATURING HER IN TOWN HALL
INTERVIEW: 'I DO NOT SUPPORT HARRIS'
What could turn around Harris? struggles with middle class voters? She needs to articulate a
platform that addresses their concerns. So far she has refused to do that.
A recent New York Times/Siena poll shows Harris racking up her biggest advantage with Black
voters (77%) and with college graduates (60% White 64% non-White). The survey which showsHarris tied with Donald Trump nationally shows the former president is most popular with whites
without a college degree (65%) ? i.e. working-class Americans.
People earning between $50000 and $200000 a year make up 59% of the likely voters surveyed
by the Times; that middle-class vote is almost exactly split between Democrats Republicans and
independents. Today independents are breaking in favor of Trump but the poll shows they are not
yet 100% committed to voting for him.
That means some voters are still up for grabs.
HARRIS CAMPAIGN COULD DEVOLVE INTO 'FINGER-POINTING' IF POLLS GO SOUTH
WARNS REPORTER
Kamala Harris is trying to grab those voters by resorting to the failed Hillary Clinton playbook of
packing her events with celebrities; as we saw with Clinton in 2016 the approach does not always
succeed. In late July early in her campaign Harris spoke to a large crowd at Georgia State
University; many attendees reportedly came to see rapper Megan Thee Stallion who performed
before Harris took the stage. A reporter for the right-leaning outlet Turning Point USA posted a video
on X of people leaving half-way through the Democratic nominee?s speech suggesting Harris had
not been the principal attraction.
Harris needs to explain to voters how her administration will make life better for the majority of the
country which has fallen behind these past few years. The Census Bureau reported recently that
Americans? average income (adjusted for inflation) was actually lower in 2023 than in 2019 before
COVID. Moreover between 2017 and 2019 while Trump was president mean incomes rose 10%.
Under Biden-Harris between 2021 and 2023 incomes actually fell 4.8%. If Harris wants to win sheneeds to tell voters how she?ll turn that around. Pretty sure it has nothing to do with her growing up
in a middle-class family.
CNN COMMENTATOR SLAMS HARRIS AFTER OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN: 'WHEN HAS SHE
SAT DOWN WITH ANY HOSTILE MEDIA?'
Harris and her Democratic Party have moved far to the left on issues like income redistribution
reparations law enforcement allowing biological men to compete in women?s sports and the role of
government in our lives leaving many moderate Democrats and independents behind. In the Times
poll 47% of respondents described Harris as ""too liberal or progressive"" while only 6% think she is
not liberal or progressive enough.
Democrats don?t get it: handing control of your party over to elites on the East and West coast
(Harris leads in those regions) leads to extreme policies that don?t play well for the majority of
Americans. Opening our border and allowing millions of unvetted migrants to enter our country
ushering in deadly fentanyl gangs and terror suspects is not popular. Throwing hundreds of billions
of dollars to force conversion to unpopular electric vehicles and backing regulations that have
caused electricity prices to soar more than 20% does not sit well with voters. Spending trillions on
leftist priorities and causing inflation that makes people poorer does not win votes.
That is why Kamala Harris has flip-flopped on so many issues. She knows that her progressive
agenda will not win in November. Pennsylvania provides a great example of her challenge.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Election soothsayers say Pennsylvania is key to winning in November and the state?s blue-collarvote will determine the outcome. Philadelphia voters back Harris by a huge margin (76% to Trump?s
16%) but Trump is currently leading in the rest of the state 48% to 46%. To win Pennsylvania
Harris must get Philadelphia voters to turn out but must also make inroads with rural conservative
voters.
UNEARTHED VIDEO REITERATES HARRIS? PREVIOUS SUPPORT FOR FRACKING BAN
That?s why Harris has campaigned in Pennsylvania more than a dozen times and why many in her
party thought she should have chosen Josh Shapiro the state's popular governor to be her running
mate. Causing alarm in the Harris camp: GOP voter registration in Pennsylvania is outpacing
Democrats. One analysis concluded ""Democrats in Pennsylvania are entering the home stretch of
the 2024 election with their weakest voter registration advantage compared with Republicans in
recent decades.""
It is also why she is coy about her energy policies. Having adamantly called for a ban on fracking
during the 2019 Democratic primary her campaign now claims her views have changed.
Since fracking accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania and billions in revenue
voters in the state support the activity. Since Harris has not explained her change of heart voters
are unlikely to believe her on fracking or a host of other issues where she has shifted her stance.

In the Times poll only 35% thought Harris ""says what she believes"" while 60% credited Trump for
saying what he believes.Star-studded events can make headlines but they cannot substitute for meaningful policies. Harris
continues to avoid face-to-face encounters with reporters and it is easy to understand why. She is
afraid of revealing her true progressive leanings which will lose the middle class and the election.

96,Conservative,FOX News,"Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics
Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said
the regime is America?s biggest foe.
In a sit-down with CBS? ""60 Minutes"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the
U.S.?s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind which is Iran. Iran has
American blood on their hands.""
""This attack on Israel 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves
the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""
Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a
nuclear weapon.
""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment"" she told Bill Whitaker.
The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows ? as China is
thought by many to be foe No. 1.
""Iran is our biggest adversary not China?"" Mary Kissel former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike
Pompeo wrote on X the platform formerly known as Twitter.
5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' ?60 MINUTES? INTERVIEW
""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America?s greatest adversary rather than
China"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.""Really? It?s not Russia? It?s not China? A middle power is America?s greatest adversary?"" Iranian
nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.
Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel ? at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that
aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.
""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that
were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel"" she said.
Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas Hezbollah... Iran"" asserting it is ""without any question our
imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""
Still she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.
""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around
making clear our principles which include the need for humanitarian aid the need for this war to
end the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She
added ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region
including Arab leaders.""
""China is the far greater threat just about I think everyone's estimation"" said Rob Greenway a
former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as
a threat then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""
Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctionson Iran which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period"" and prompted the
turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 2023.
During a rally last week Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S.
and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen
Iranian assets from oil sales.
""If they have somebody who was kidnapped it?s always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump
said. ""Somebody else gets like $4000.""
Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on
Monday.
The Biden administration meanwhile has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But
""it's not enforcing any sanctions"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion
per year from oil sales.
Last week Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv many of them intercepted by both Israeli
Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran?s proxies have long attacked both Israeli and
U.S. postures it was the regime?s first direct attack on Israel since April.
Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden
campaigned on returning to the deal but failed to do so in office.
""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S.
administration"" Greenway said.HARRIS' ?WORD SALAD? ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE
The Trump administration?s policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""
After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a
nuclear bomb to 7000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear
weapon.) It went from exporting 400000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump
administration?s harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.
Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran ? Sanjarian and
Golab Dareh.
Last week Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was
""proportional"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.
Trump on Friday said Israel should go after the nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville North Carolina he said when Biden was asked
about Israel attacking Iran the president answered ""?As long as they don?t hit the nuclear stuff.?
That?s the thing you wanna hit right? I said ?I think he?s got that one wrong. Isn?t that what
you?re supposed to hit??""
He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the
nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'""",FOX News_Kamala_Harris__tough_words_on_Iran_confounds_criti.pdf.pdf,news_articles

to have Obama ?scold? Black men on voting
HBO host Bill Maher suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris? prospects for winning the 2024
presidential election aren?t looking too good less than a month out from Nov. 5.
During Friday's episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" the comedian commented on the state of the
race declaring that the fact that the Democratic Party is having to prod Black men into supporting
Harris is a bad sign.
""And I gotta say it?s not looking that great for the Democrats"" he said at the start of his show Friday
night.
KELLYANNE CONWAY: TRUMP VS. HARRIS: DON'T RULE OUT A 'NARROW LANDSLIDE'
He continued ""This is not a good sign you know ? when you have an African American candidate
you probably shouldn?t be having to shore up your support among Black men but that?s what?s
going on.""
Harris? challenges with appealing to Black male voters were especially pronounced this week when
former President Barack Obama ripped into Black men during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh for not
being as enthusiastic about Harris? presidential bid as they were for his 2008 and 2012 political
campaigns.
""We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all corners of our neighborhoods
and communities as we saw when I was running"" he said elsewhere adding ""I?m speaking to men
directly ? part of it makes me think that well you just aren?t feeling the idea of having a woman aspresident and you?re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.""
On his program Maher mocked the fact that the campaign is going to deploy Harris? running mate
Gov. Tim Walz D-Minn. to speak to Black male voters directly.
""Tim Walz is headlining a voter engagement event tonight with Black men. Who better to connect
with young Black men than Tim Walz?"" he asked.
""Because apparently Michael Bublé was unavailable"" he quipped to raucous laughter.
BATTLEGROUND DEM WARNS TRADITIONAL VOTING BLOC BEING 'SPLIT' IN 2024
He added another punchline: ""Meanwhile Kim Kardashian?s like ?Hello??""
Maher then brought up Obama?s recent comments saying ""Obama even came out yesterday to
scold. You know he was scolding. Well I don?t know ? last month at the convention he was ?No
scolding!? Now he?s scolding. He was saying ?You gotta vote for Harris.?""
He concluded the point with one last joke stating ""But of course for some young ? especially the
younger Black men ? it?s tough choice. Harris is African American but Trump has a sneaker line.""
Later during the episode Maher spoke to his guest panel including conservative commentator Buck
Sexton and CNN host Laura Coates about the Harris campaign?s problems more generally.
Reading from recent report on Harris? polling he said ""At this point in 2020 Biden ? with far fewer
resources than Harris has ? was ten points ahead of Trump and in 2016 Hillary was six up. Andshe is only 2.6 up. Pennsylvania ? Biden was up seven at this point. She?s up one. Michigan ?

NEVADA SENATE HOPEFULS TACKLE TRANS ATHLETES IMMIGRATION AND UFOS IN ONLY
DEBATE
Nevada: One of the most competitive states this cycle
Forever a battleground reliably Democrat: That?s the story of Nevada?s presidential politics.
The state has voted for every Democrat who has run for president since 1992 except the two
elections with President Bush on the ballot. But the average margin across those eight elections is
just 4.1 points.
There are only six electoral votes at stake but they could be crucial for either candidate. If Harris
wins two of the battleground Rust Belt states but loses Pennsylvania for example then a
combination of Nevada and North Carolina would make up for the deficit.Nevada is home to the ""Reid Machine"" a voter turnout operation named after late Senate leader
Harry Reid that activates voters favorable to Democrats especially Hispanic and unionized
hospitality workers in the Las Vegas area.
Those groups aren?t as overwhelmingly Democrat as they used to be. The party has shed 10 points
worth of the Hispanic vote since 2020 and seven points of the non-college-educated vote.
Voters backed a Republican for governor in 2022; that election came two years after the COVID-19
pandemic decimated the tourism industry. They held on to their Democrat senator.

'Shocking to me' they believe Trump is going to win
Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight
2024 presidential race admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President
Trump could win the election.
""Democrats they're such a frightened group of people"" Moore said during a Monday interview on
CNN. ""I mean they still think that Trump is going to win.""
""This is kind of shocking to me. Like don?t you live with people? Are you not aware that there?s
going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said referring to

not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.
MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO ?CENTRIST?
CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.
According to the latest national Fox News poll from September Harris currently holds a two-point
edge over Trump with voters.
""I don't think it's a dead heat"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing
polling he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues rather than the
candidates.He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign such as when The New York Times predicted
on Election Day 2016 that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.
""No I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls"" he said.

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns arguing that the
VP's progressive policy positions on abortion the environment guns and jobs are actually in the
mainstream.
""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to ?tone it down'"" Moore continued. ""That's
something women have been told for decades.""
""The reason she?s so progressive ? because she believes in a woman's right to choose she
believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school?.you go down all her positions and
they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at"" he continued.

said referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.
Last week Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

106,Conservative,FOX News,"MIKE POMPEO: Kamala Harris would crush families with
big-government price controls
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
When a politician promises to use government power to force ""lower prices"" and ""transparency"" you
should expect the opposite outcome. Under the Biden-Harris administration families have faced
skyrocketing costs on everything from groceries to prescription drugs yet Vice President Kamala
Harris has proposed on the campaign trail that the best way to fix this is to insert even more federal
control into every corner of our economy. Here's why these policies would be so devastating and
lead to even higher costs for Americans.
While Harris has largely avoided the press and declined to publish policy plans on her website she
recently gave a speech outlining her economic priorities in three key areas: food healthcare and
housing. An examination of her proposals shows that they would all be disasters.
Groceries
Harris began her remarks by acknowledging that under her tenure as vice president ""a loaf of bread
costs 50% more"" and ""ground beef is up almost 50%."" She's right ? and anyone who has been to
the grocery store has seen similar price increases for eggs cereal and many other staple foods.
HARRIS DROPS MILLIONS ON PRIVATE JET SPENDING DESPITE CALLING CLIMATE
CHANGE AN 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT'
But instead of taking responsibility for the out-of-control government spending and failed policies
that actually caused these increases Harris instead proposed passing the ""first-ever federal ban onprice gouging on food."" Under this ""ban"" bureaucrats in Washington would get to decide what
constitutes gouging ? or in other words what they think the price should be.
Banning ""price gouging"" is not a new or novel idea ? it?s just that when the Soviet Union was still
around we called it by its proper name: price controls. Federal bureaucrats at the Federal Trade
Commission would decide a ""fair"" price for bread in Pittsburgh or milk in Topeka.
Price controls don?t work for very simple and sound reasons. Grocery stores operate on very thin
profit margins often just a few percentage points. So when a federal bureaucrat tells them they
must sell bacon for less than what it costs them to purchase it they simply won?t sell bacon.
Smaller stores that rely on sales of such products to survive would go under. Customers would be
left with fewer options to buy bacon at all. And as stores stop selling bacon there would be less of a
market for farmers and ranchers to produce it reducing supply and pushing prices even higher ? as
competition and incentives collapse. This isn?t just theory. We literally saw it happen to the Soviet
Union.
The price hikes we?re seeing under the Biden-Harris administration are driven by inflation across
the market not by suddenly greedy grocery store owners. The solution is to return to responsible
limited government and a pro-growth economic platform ? not impose ruinous price controls that
would set a course toward total implosion of our economy.
Healthcare
Harris?s healthcare proposals have received less attention but are just as damaging. She criticized
pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) ? the companies that negotiate lower drug costs on behalf ofemployers and other purchasers of healthcare coverage.
I ran small businesses in Kansas and having seen the high cost of prescription drugs for
employees I know the importance of these negotiations and the savings they produce. Harris?s
attacks on PBMs follows years of anti-PBM policies from the current administration particularly from
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan.
While transparency sounds appealing what she?s really proposing is for PBMs to disclose publicly
? including to all drug manufacturers?the savings they secure in negotiations.
Disclosing this information would be good only for the biggest drug manufacturers. It would allow
them to gain a government-created upper hand in knowing which drugs they can discount less
ultimately meaning higher prices for patients.
Imagine if grocery stores had to disclose to food manufacturers the prices they paid to other
manufacturers. This would effectively end negotiations and set one price for everyone ? a higher
price. And just as it would be harmful for grocery stores forcing PBMs to reveal their negotiated
prices would allow pharmaceutical companies to raise costs for patients.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Additional proposals targeting the market-based cost-saving role of PBMs have been touted by
Harris allies in Congress. These proposed government mandates would eliminate market-based
incentives that produce savings through competition and negotiation hiking healthcare costs for
employers and consumers by billions of dollars each year while artificially increasing drug company
profits.Healthcare costs have already risen under the Biden-Harris administration. Government intervention
would drive them even higher making it harder for American businesses to offer cost-effective
prescription drug coverage and increasing costs for consumers and taxpayers.
Housing
Finally Harris turned to housing costs a fitting focus given that average mortgage rates have nearly
tripled since the Biden-Harris administration took office. She proposed preventing landlords from
setting ""artificially high rental prices"" which might sound appealing ? until you consider that this
means federal bureaucrats would decide what constitutes a ""fair"" rent.
The price hikes we?re seeing under the Biden-Harris administration are driven by inflation across
the market not by suddenly greedy grocery store owners. The solution is to return to responsible
limited government and a pro-growth economic platform ? not impose ruinous price controls that
would set a course toward total implosion of our economy.
If federal bureaucrats control housing costs it would discourage homebuilders from entering the
market. Why would builders invest their capital and time constructing homes if after making that
investment a federal official could arbitrarily decide its valuation? Fewer homes being built would
lead to even higher prices for both renters and homebuyers.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
ConclusionThe consistent theme in Harris?s economic approach is clear: she believes the government knows
better than the free market and that putting the government in control will somehow lower prices.
Every leftist leader promises that just a little more government intervention will lead to better
outcomes ? but common sense and history tell us this approach doesn?t work. You can?t fix
problems caused by socialism with more socialism. Americans should reject these reckless policies

Early in-person and mail-in ballots have begun pouring in across the country and the tally in each
state reveals mounting voter enthusiasm.
Recent polling suggests a razor-thin margin in the race between former President Donald Trump
and Vice President Kamala Harris and the results are expected to come down to each candidate?s
performance in seven swing states: Pennsylvania Georgia Arizona Michigan Wisconsin Nevada
and North Carolina.
States have long allowed at least some Americans to vote early like members of the military and
people with illnesses unable to get to the polls. Many states expanded eligibility in 2020 during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT ARE ELECTION BETTING ODDS? EXPERT EXPLAINS WHY TRUMP IS CURRENT
FAVORITE
In the last presidential election mail ballots tended to skew Democratic. In 2020 60% of Democrats
reported voting by mail compared to 32% of Republicans according to a 2021 study from the MIT
Election Data and Science Lab.
As of Wednesday morning more than 19 million ballots have been cast nationwide.
Here is a breakdown of where early ballots have been cast either by mail or in person in the seven
battleground states according to The Associated Press.
Arizona ? 666820Georgia ? 1690702
Michigan ? 1048336
North Carolina ? 1381184
Nevada ? 260052
Pennsylvania ? 1051655
Wisconsin ? 360372
Over the past two decades the prevalence of early voting has skyrocketed. While early ballots
demonstrate voter enthusiasm they do not reliably determine which candidate is winning the race
because fewer voters are expected to cast early votes than in the previous presidential election.
In 2020 the Fox News Voter Analysis found that 71% of voters cast their ballots before Election
Day with 30% voting early in-person and 41% voting by mail. This time polls suggest that around
four in 10 voters will show up before Nov. 5 according to Gallup polling.
DOJ DEPLOYS DISTRICT ELECTIONS OFFICERS TO HANDLE 'THREATS AND INTIMIDATION'
Democrats and Republicans are expected to be less divided on early voting this cycle. Four years
ago Democrats won the total early vote by 11 points. However two things have changed: first with
the COVID-19 pandemic no longer front-of-mind many voters will be more willing to show up onElection Day. Second unlike in 2020 Trump and the GOP are no longer discouraging their voters
from casting an early ballot. The upshot should be a smaller partisan gap once the votes are
counted.
Some states also offer breakdowns of their early ballots ? for example by party affiliation race or
age. Comparing these results to other elections might give the impression that one candidate or
party is now doing better than the other.

Additionally while early vote data shows the party registration of some voters it does not reveal how
they voted. States do not release actual vote counts until election night. The vote data that some
states are releasing now shows the party affiliation of voters who have requested or returned a
ballot. However that is not the same as their actual vote. For example a voter may have registered
as a Democrat decades ago but chose to vote for Trump this year. Many voters are not registered
to either party making their vote even more of a mystery.",FOX News_Millions_of_voters_have_already_cast_ballots_for_N.pdf.pdf,news_articles

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT
ENDORSING HARRIS
Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana where Republicans including
former President Trump supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the
vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP
West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat
Glenn Elliott meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.
Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and given that the state is
overwhelmingly Republican Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice
President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public
dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the
Southern Border.

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration

Tester however has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on
the campaign trail and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August when she was
named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.
The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his
opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on
immigration.
""Look I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern
border"" Tester said Monday.Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe
v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago
returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.
The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were
""insensitive"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing
supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m."" while working cattle

EXCLUSIVE: Montana's U.S. Senate race has one of the most ""intense"" ground games of the 2024
cycle with the chamber majority hanging in the balance according to the chairman of the Republican
campaign arm.
Sen. Steve Daines is spearheading Republican efforts to take control of the Senate as chairman of
the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) with a heightened emphasis on ousting a
three-term Democrat in red state Montana.
Daines exclusively told Fox News Digital the Montana Senate race pitting Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy
against three-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester features one of the strongest ground game efforts
from the GOP he has witnessed in the state.
""I've watched a lot of Montana Senate races House races governor races over the years. This is
the most intense ground game operation and the most far-reaching that I've seen in many election
cycles"" Daines told Fox News Digital. ""It's a door-to-door type of persuasion as well as a lot of
phoning a lot of digital. So it's a really strong ground game knowing that I think well-run ground
games win elections.""

The New York Times recently reported that Sheehy is leading Tester by eight percentage points but
Daines emphasized that while the Republican candidate remains ahead in several polls they are
going to continue energizing their get-out-the-vote efforts until Election Day.""It's a very aggressive active time with just a little over 2½ weeks until the election focused on voter
turnout and ground game operations as well as continuing to have the sufficient resources"" Daines
said. ""Get the message out to those few undecided voters that are left whether it's through
television radio digital mail. So we're not letting up. You keep working hard all the way until
Election Day.""
The Montana race figures to be the most expensive Senate race on a per-vote basis which Daines
attributes to its high stakes.
""This is what secures the majority for the Republicans and takes the gavel out of Chuck Schumer's
hands"" he told Fox. ""And that's why there's so much focused attention on this race.""
In early September two political forecasters shifted the Montana race from a toss-up to ""leans
Republican"" along with AARP and the NYT surveys showing the Republican leading the race
against the three-term Democrat.
A visit to Bozeman by former President Trump in August who endorsed Sheehy earlier this year
contributed to the recent polling shift in the Republican candidate's favor according to the chairman.
KEY SENATOR REPORTEDLY BEHIND HARRIS' RISE IN POWER WITHHOLDS HIS
ENDORSEMENT FOR PRESIDENT
The electorate in Montana has shifted toward the GOP over the years and Tester remains the only
Democrat to hold a statewide office in the state.""I think what's happened is Montana in terms of their voting and their thinking has moved a bit
more. But the biggest problem for the Democrats is they've moved so far left. This is not the same
Democrat Party that I grew up with here in Montana"" Daines said of the red wave in the state.
Daines also highlighted the national implications of the Big Sky Senate race.
""This race is bigger than Montana because this race indeed will decide the future of the United
States Supreme Court the future of the circuit courts"" Daines said. ""There's also the Trump tax cuts
that expire in '25 which would be a massive tax increase for Montana's small businesses.
""Jon Tester voted against that tax bill. I voted for it. Tim Sheehy would vote for that. So there's just
a lot at stake not only for Montana but for the nation. And so we here in Montana will probably be
able to flip the majority control of the U.S. Senate with Tim Sheehy's victory. And that has significant
implications not only for the great state of Montana but for our great country.""

NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
The remarks delivered by Vice President Kamala Harris at Koinonia Christian Center in Greenville
North Carolina on Sunday did not set off alarm bells about Christian nationalism in the way say ten
minutes of Donald Trump at the Dallas church of Pastor Robert Jeffries or a speech before the
Catholic Conference of Bishops would.
It has long been a feature not a bug of political coverage in America to decry Republicans talking at
church gatherings but to ignore as inconvenient to the dominant legacy media narrative of ""danger
on the right!"" the vibrant (and entirely constitutionally appropriate) appearance of Democrats before
large Black congregations in the run-up to elections.
I played all of the Harris?s remarks on my Monday program because she?s getting roasted online
for a rough beginning and a rough ending. The criticism was unfair. She did a workmanlike job. The
context reveals she delivered a very nice sermon on the Christian call to help the distressed and it
was somewhat surprising as I have never heard her discuss faith before.
It was a conventional Christian message and is remarkable only because she is the most overtly
left-wing major party nominee in our history and many of her public policy positions?taxpayer funded
gender transition surgeries for inmates?would not be featured in the sermons of the African
American pastors I know (only four and all four of whom are I think very liberal).
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
I played the entire sermon because Harris is obviously having trouble with the turnout andenthusiasm metrics among the African American electorate (hence the dressing down of Black men
last week by former President Obama for not being all in with Harris. This too struck many as
tone-deaf. When you feel desperate though you try desperate things.
I?ve also been lobbying for CBS to publish the unedited transcript of the Harris 60 Minutes interview
because we know so little about her. I routinely quickly publish the complete audio and transcript of
every interview with a newsmaker (e.g. former President Trump last week.)
CBS ?60 MINUTES' FAILS TO ADDRESS HARRIS EDIT CONTROVERSY IN LATEST EPISODE
On Monday Harris followed up her and Obama?s outreach to the Black electorate with a sit down
with podcaster Roland Martin. Harris was for 50 days to do any interviews and then only with
interviewers who could be reliably counted upon to use a soft focus lens and the power to edit her
word salads into something at least approaching the intelligible. Harris has been very
hesitant?completely unwilling actually?to seek out a Guy Benson or Mary Katharine Ham or
me?very civil center-right long-form interviewers. She chose to appear with Roland Martin because
she needed to. She hasn?t locked down the Black vote margin she needs and the election is three
weeks away. Martin is well known very left wing and not at all a setting that could expand her
appeal beyond her base. To repeat: She?s doing base repair and maintenance three weeks out.
That?s a sign?a very very bad sign for Harris-Walz. (Walz's disastrous hunting escapade didn?t
help either. Did she pick him because it was actually impossible for him to show her up?)
But I do appreciate her preaching at a church in election season as it should (probably won?t but
should) tamp down the ""Christian nationalism is sweeping American churches!"" drumbeat. It?s not.
We are pretty much exactly where we are less 10-20% of attenders across all denominations from
when I began covering religion in America in 1991 on radio and 1992 on television. The fastestgrowing theology is climate crisis theology. For every other band of pilgrim rough times have
marked the past 20 years and more are ahead.

The problem isn?t however the rise of a revolutionary and armed Christian resistance. The problem
is that Judeo-Christian values once defined the political norms in America. They no longer do. Ours
is a secular society that protects its religious minorities. The one good thing I can credit Vice
President Harris with doing is this simple thing: Taking her campaign to a church. It?s a fine act that
does not endanger the church?s tax-exempt status. Bravo Vice President Harris. I doubt it will work
but after a week like you had last week seeking prayers for the campaign is a far better strategy
than finding a safe place for Governor Walz to do an interview.

112,Conservative,FOX News,"Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel
NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!
Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific
massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of
course but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.
There were three key exchanges. (The complete transcript is here.)
The first exchange:
HH: Now Mr. President when we spoke in April you said to me that Israel needed to win and win
quickly. They are winning but they?re still fighting and they?re now fighting in Lebanon. Do you
think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?
DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular him. Now she?s a dumber person
than him but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history probably. You know what you do
with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All
you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you?ve done the opposite for 30 years with
this poor guy this poor pathetic guy if you?ve done the opposite for 30 years you would have
been successful. But he?s never gotten it right. And you know I don?t have to go back into the old
secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

The second exchange:HH: If Israel hits [Iran?s] nuclear sites will you applaud?
DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit
differently when they have nuclear weapons.
HH: Yes.
DT: Does that make sense to you?
HH: Yes it does. Well Nixon met with Mao who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century
because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.
DT: Right.
HH: I noticed you didn?t meet with Khamenei and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to
have nukes?
DT: No they can?t have nukes. No they can?t have nukes. Nukes if you would see the power of
these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost I rebuilt the whole military. And then you
know they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They
gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people these are the
worst negotiators in history.
Exchange three:HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your
grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many
American campuses. Your alma mater my alma mater Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean
they really have ignored it. If you?re president will you send the DOJ to those campuses the office
of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?
DT: 100%. I mean the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn?t think you?d even have this. Did
you ever think two years ago three years ago that you?d ever have this discussion?
HH: No I didn?t.
DT: I?m unbelievable what?s happening. And when you see these riots and you see a lot of people
too. But you know a lot of the people in that a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know
that. They?re Jewish kids.
HH: Oh yeah. There are some outliers but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places
like Harvard and Penn.
DT: Yeah but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah that?s true and they
should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they?re
saying and what they?re doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put
them down quickly.
Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers but as the
excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish
Americans attacking Israel and defending implicitly or even explicitly Hamas then it should not beshocking when the former president notices it too.
I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November?s election will reverberate around
the world but most especially in Israel.
US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE ?VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY? ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR
AFTER OCT. 7
It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president
of the Jewish State in Israel?s 76-year history.
By contrast the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous
president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the
Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur
War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril
to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a
choice in his first term but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued
existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should
vote for Trump.

113,Conservative,FOX News,"MSNBC guest claims Trump supporters will ?burn down? election
centers to stop Black votes
Anti-Trump political strategist Stuart Stevens argued Tuesday that the former president's supporters
will resort to violence to ensure Trump retakes the White House.
On Tuesday a panel on MSNBC spoke about how the Trump campaign had told NBC that its
election integrity program has ""recruited over 200000 volunteers to Protect the Vote ? these patriots
have volunteered their time to bring transparency and accountability to our election process.""
MSNBC host Chris Jansing argued that conflicts in 2020 may foretell future political conflict
recalling when Trump supporters had concerns about election fraud in multiple cities amid record
levels of mail-in voting and absentee ballots.
Stevens a former Mitt Romney campaign strategist who is now a vehement critic of the Republican
Party was asked whether he sees potential for ""havoc"" as the 2024 election looms.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW
""Look this is 100% about race. Let?s don?t [sic] pretend it?s anything else"" he claimed. ""It has
been from the beginning. Where are all these suspect votes? Detroit Philadelphia Atlanta. What do
they have in common? High percentage of African American voters. Those that voted not to certify
those elections were basically trying to disenfranchise millions and millions of Black voters. It?s that
simple.""
The strategist then evoked images from American segregation arguing that Republicans unable to
win the election fairly will resort to violence""You know they can?t stop Blacks from voting anymore the way they did in the ?60s with the same
kind of success though with these voter challenges they?re going to try"" he said. ""And I think what
is really to fear here is put yourself in the mindset that if the Trump campaign really doesn?t think it
can win either the popular vote or Electoral College. You look at this campaign it makes no sense.
He?s not trying to add voters. What they want to do is they want to win the election night until the
inauguration. And if they can go in and they can violently disrupt these counting centers how will
states be able to certify elections? You burn down a county center in Arizona how does the
governor certify those elections? What world are we in then?""
HARRIS MAKES NEW PITCH FOR BLACK MALES AMID POLLING GAINS BY TRUMP
He stood by his grim claim ""I think that we really have to anticipate that think about it. One of the
great ridiculousness about this big lie campaign is there was not one Secretary of State in America
the majority of whom were Republicans who said that the election in their state was anything short
of by the standard rules fair and free. But that didn?t stop Trump.""

Harris: 'Why would you even cover that?'
Former Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi scolded CNN host Jake Tapper for playing
a clip of former President Trump criticizing the vice president during an interview Tuesday.
Tapper said he's heard from progressive and Democratic voters who want the media to cover
Trump's ""cognitive problems"" as much as they did President Biden's and asked for Pelosi's reaction
to Trump talking about it.
He then played a clip of Trump saying on Tuesday ""They laugh at us all over the world. They're

that she's going to be president. They can?t believe- You talk about cognitive problems? She's got

The news host then summarized ""Donald Trump saying that Kamala Harris has bigger cognitive
problems than Joe Biden.""
""Why would you even cover that?"" Pelosi demanded. ""This is a person who?s not on the level. He is
their nominee for president. He is incompetent. Let?s not even talk about the silliness of it all and

After the former House speaker criticized Trump for a litany of issues including ""The worst job

Tapper later defended himself for showing the clip of Trump.
""Let me just say why do I run that clip? I run that clip because that?s the Republican presidential
nominee and I thought you might have a reaction to it"" he said.
At the DNC in August Tapper retreated after pushback from Pelosi for asking about tensions

previous poll is 'gone'
NBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki said that some polling numbers for Vice
President Kamala Harris have ""completely reversed"" in recent days.
Harris was once touted by many of her supporters as the inevitable winner of the 2024 election but
with less than a month before the election the race appears to be a dead heat. NBC ""Today"" host
Savannah Guthrie discussed how recent polling shows the race ""deadlocked.""
Guthrie then did a deep dive on the numbers with Kornacki and said ""I mean the top line is the
5-point advantage that Kamala Harris had in our last poll is gone. What?s behind that shift?""
TRUMP TAKES LEAD IN 6 OUT OF 7 BATTLEGROUND STATES IN RECENT POLLING
Kornacki agreed contrasting previous polling that took place after the first Trump-Harris debate
versus now amid Harris' media blitz. The polling showed Trump had risen from 44% to 48%
whereas Harris had declined from 49% to 48%.
In one noteworthy poll however Harris had declined significantly as Kornacki noted ""some things
that have changed in that time. I think this might be the biggest for Harris.""
""We just asked the basic image perception people have is it positive or negative of these
candidates? The Trump number?s always been somewhere in this territory"" he said as he gestured
at Trump having a 43% positive and 51% negative rating. ""In fact this is a little bit high for him
believe it or not.""IF 2024 POLLING ERRORS MIRROR THOSE IN 2020 ELECTION TRUMP ?WINS IN A

But he said that Harris? numbers have notably changed.
""But look at Harris 43 positive 49 negative. The significance we polled this a month ago. She was
48% positive and 45 negative. She was above water as they say. That?s completely reversed. It
now looks very similar to Trump?s. That?s a pretty big shift when you?re talking about a race this
close"" he added.
He then noted further polling indicating that only a quarter of families say Biden-era policies are
helping their family whereas 45% say they are ""hurting"" them.
""And then here?s the interesting twist. We also asked folks ?Think back to when Donald Trump was
president. Did his policies help or hurt your family?? And look at the difference 44% helping 31

blue-state seat
Fresh off headlines that the Democrats' Senate nominee in Maryland received an improper tax

in homeowners association fees.
According to documents obtained by Fox News Alsobrooks failed to pay $8121 in homeowners
association fees on time in seven cases from 2008 through 2021.

BLUE-STATE REPUBLICAN TOUTS HIS ANTI-TRUMP CREDENTIALS
The Senate contest in the overwhelmingly blue state is one of a handful that may decide if the GOP
wins back the chamber's majority in the November elections.
Polling in the summer indicated a close contest but the most recent survey released last week by
the Washington Post and the University of Maryland pointed to an 11-point lead by Alsosbrooks. But
this month's acknowledgment of an improper tax credit received by Alsobrooks handed Hogan some
political ammunition.SENATE DEMOCRATS CAMPAIGN CHAIR GOES ONE-ON-ONE WITH FOX NEWS

The tax credits which Alsobrooks did not qualify for included one meant for low-income senior

residence.

A new poll indicates surging support among America's youngest voters for Vice President Harris in

Harris tops Trump by 31 points among people aged 18-29 likely to vote in the presidential election
according to a poll released Tuesday morning by Harvard University's Institute of Politics (IOP) at
the Harvard Kennedy School.
That's a dramatic switch from Harvard's survey from this spring which indicated President Biden

Among them a significant enthusiasm gap of nearly three-quarters of young Democrats saying they
will ""definitely"" vote compared to 6-in-10 Republicans and a jump in Harris' approval rating as vice
president from 32% in the spring to 44% now. Harris' favorable rating now stands at plus five points

But in the dash for campaign cash ? another key metric in presidential politics ? there is one very
clear frontrunner: Harris.
The vice president entered the final full month of the campaign with a massive financial advantage
over the former president according to new federal fundraising filings late Sunday.
The Harris campaign hauled in $221.8 million in September according to the filings more than triple

Roughly a quarter of the money raked in by the vice president came during celebrity-studded
fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the end of last month.
Harris has vastly outraised and outspent Trump since replacing President Biden atop the
Democrats' 2024 ticket three months ago and that trend continued in September. The largest
expense by the Harris campaign was for paid media ? mostly to run ads.

fundraising didn't last and by early July began to significantly slow down.
Biden bowed out of the 2024 race on July 21 and the party quickly consolidated around Harris who
instantly saw her fundraising soar spurred by small-dollar donations.The Harris campaign on Sunday spotlighted its grassroots donors as it announced that 95% of its
donations in the past three months were under $200.
This isn't the first time Trump's faced a fundraising deficit. He raised less than 2016 Democratic
presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his White House victory and Biden four years ago in his
re-election defeat.

When asked about the fundraising deficit Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley
told Fox News Digital last month that ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always
have a ton of money.""
However he emphasized that ""we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message
out to all the voters that we?re talking to and feel very comfortable that we?re going to be able to
see this campaign through and we?re going to win on Nov. 5.""
The presidential campaigns later this week will give us another look at their finances ? as they're
required on Thursday to file reports to the Federal Election Commission for their fundraising for the
first 16 days of October.
Fundraising along with polling is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's
popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used to ? among other things ?

rebuking Biden: He 'stood in the way'
The New Yorker magazine issued a scathing rebuke of President Biden in its official endorsement of
Vice President Kamala Harris published Sunday.
The magazine heaped praise on Harris for displaying ""the basic values and political skills"" to defeat
former President Trump in a lengthy endorsement but not before scolding President Biden for
standing in her way.
""It was hardly a secret that Biden has aged growing markedly less robust particularly in the past
eighteen months or so. If he got through an interview or a (rare) press conference without incident
staff and supporters exhaled and treated it as a victory"" the editors wrote.
FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS SAYS ELECTION
OFFERS ?STARK CHOICE?
""But rather than open the gate to a younger generation of Democratic candidates Biden his
advisers and the Party leadership stood in the way. They made it plain that a challenger would
inevitably be defeated. Meanwhile through spin and deft scheduling the White House staff
protected the President and hoped for the best. Tens of millions of voters fearing another Trump
Presidency had little choice but to close their eyes and think of America"" the endorsement reads.
The editors wrote that the infamous debate which led to the end of Biden's re-election bid
broadcast to the world the extent of his ""disintegration.""
""Viewed more coldly it was a gift. Had it taken place say after the Conventions it might have beentoo late to force a reassessment"" the article reads.
""Trump said? ?I really don?t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don?t think he knows
what he said either.? By Trumpian standards this was a kindness. It was also the end of the Biden
candidacy"" the editors continue.
The endorsement also spends a significant portion attacking Trump calling him a ""menacing
presence in American life.""
""There?s every reason to think that Trump II would be far worse than Trump I"" they wrote.
HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE
Harris they wrote has ""got the ?vibes? as this year?s cliché has it. But the race remains very
close.
""In both 2016 and 2020 Trump outperformed the polls. No responsible assessment of the contest
has the luxury of focussing only on the imperatives for a Harris Administration and gliding past the
ramifications of another Trump Administration"" the editors continue.
The New Yorker was among the first left-leaning publications to urge Biden to step aside after his
disastrous debate performance in June.
""Watching Thursday?s debate observing Biden wander into senselessness onstage  was an
agonizing experience and it is bound to obliterate forever all those vague and qualified descriptions

122,Conservative,FOX News,"Non-college educated White voters are keeping Kamala Harris 'in the
ball game' CNN data reporter says
CNN data reporter Harry Enten said Monday that non-college educated White voters have slightly
shifted away from former President Trump over the last two election cycles and that movement was
likely keeping Vice President Kamala Harris ""in the ball game.""
""What?s so interesting because we?ve seen so many groups this year moving in Donald Trump?s
direction so you would think his core group his base of support would be doing the same. But in
fact it?s moving a little bit away from him"" Enten said.
Enten has also done reporting on other key voting demographics that have been shifting towards
Trump over the last few cycles such as Black voters and Hispanic voters. The data reporter pointed
out that Trump won the non-college educated White voter group by 33 points in 2016 and by 31
points in 2020.
""The latest average of polls he?s only up by 27"" Enten said. ""Now that may not seem like a lot but
given that we?re seeing these double-digit gains say among Black voters or among Hispanic voters
in some of the polls the fact that we?re seeing this core group of supporters actually moving away
from him not just off of the 2016 baseline but the 2020 baseline as well. I think that?s a rather
interesting development.""
CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH ?UNDERPERFORMANCE? FROM
YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT
Enten said that the shift mattered because the non-college educated White voters make up 40% of
the electorate nationally but 51% of the electorate in the key battleground states of PennsylvaniaMichigan and Wisconsin. The three states have all been bellwethers since 2008; beginning with
Barack Obama that year the winners of those states have also won the presidential election.
""Again you see it back in 2016 Donald Trump won by 25. You?ll see a small movement in 2020
Donald Trump winning by 22 and look at that where we are today again Trump is ahead but his
margins are smaller. And when you have a shrinking margin for Donald Trump among his core
group that makes up the majority of voters it can make up for big shifts among smaller groups in the
electorate and this is why Kamala Harris is still in the ball game right now"" Enten said.
He added that Harris was losing ""big league"" among groups that make up a smaller portion of the
electorate but is ""making it up"" among bigger portions of the electorate.

CNN's John Berman said the movement was interesting and noted that Trump was making gains
among voters of color.
""White voters and non-college Whites and college Whites especially they make up a lion?s share
of the electorate and so even if you?re seeing small movements among these groups among
non-college Whites slightly larger among college Whites. It more than makes up or at least makes
up for the movement among voters of color"" Enten said.
Enten has also sounded the alarm on the idea that polling has historically underestimated Donald
Trump in previous elections which projected him losing soundly in both 2016 and 2020.

Early in-person voting kicks off Thursday in North Carolina one of seven hotly contested

Some North Carolina communities are making last-minute adjustments to their 2024 election
schedules in the fallout from Hurricane Helene this month.
In Buncombe County one of the counties hit hardest by the storm the board of elections approved
new times and locations for early voting. Early in-person voting kicks off Thursday morning with
polls remaining open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Nov. 1.
""We?ve got a new early voting plan"" Buncombe Board of Elections Chair Jake Quinn said in a
statement. ""Please everybody spread the word.""
Buncombe is also having to adjust polling locations as some are no longer fit to serve as polling
places or are more difficult to access. The county published a list of locations that are now operating
for early voting.

their timing to be open on weekends during early voting. Residents will be able to access polling
places from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.
""We are grateful to all the people that worked so hard to build our county?s infrastructure back so

They say roughly 25 counties were heavily impacted by Helene and those contain 80 polling
locations. Officials say 76 of those locations will be operational for early voting. Karen Brinson Bellexecutive director of the NC State Board of Elections and Corinne Duncan the Buncombe County
elections director will lead the press conference.
The majority of North Carolina voters in the 25 counties impacted by Helene are Republican
according to state voter registration records. Officials say 482930 registered Republicans live in the
area compared to 294106 Democrats. There are also 492546 unaffiliated voters.
North Carolina is one of the most competitive states this cycle
North Carolina last voted for a Democrat president in 2008 when then-Sen. Barack Obama won the
state by 0.3 points or 14177 votes.
Trump pulled out a convincing 3.7 point win in 2016 but that margin shrank to 1.3 points against
Biden in 2020.
Late last month the Fox News Poll had the two 2024 presidential candidates just a point apart from
each other with Democrat nominee Vice President Harris at 49% and GOP nominee former
President Trump at 50%. North Carolina is ranked a Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings.
The state has become more competitive as its population has grown. Over the last full decade
North Carolina added roughly 1.1 million people the fourth-largest gain among all states.
Much of that growth has been in urban and suburban areas like those in solidly blue Mecklenburg
and Wake counties.
The pandemic brought more wealthy urban Americans from surrounding states and there arepockets of college voters as well.
Rural areas have experienced some population decline but they remain a powerful part of the
state?s overall vote and they vote overwhelmingly Republican.

New York Times columnist Michelle Cottle mocked Vice President Kamala Harris' interview with
liberal radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday and said the Democratic nominee spent an ""hour in the
warm embrace"" of the radio host.
""Stern was a little too openly butt-smoochy for my taste but I like a little more spice in my political
interviews"" Cottle wrote suggesting Harris go on ""Hot Ones"" next where host Sean Evans asks his
guests questions as they attempt to eat hot wings covered in various sauces.
Stern was one of three friendly interview stops for Harris this week as she also appeared on ABC's
""The View"" and with late-night host Stephen Colbert. Stern a big critic of former President Trump
told the vice president that he was voting for her during the interview and repeatedly went after
Harris' opponent.
""Yes folks hoping to find serious policy talk on the Stern show were out of luck. But honestly any
voters still undecided at this late date are unlikely to be making their decision based on the
nitty-gritty of the candidates? tax plans"" Cottle wrote.

DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN
""Who could resist the opportunity to outsource some Trump bashing to a professional trash-talker
like Stern who famously disdains the MAGA king?"" the columnist added.
During an hourlong live interview with the Democratic presidential candidate Stern repeatedlyripped into Trump and expressed disbelief that anyone would vote for him. At one point he claimed
the sun would ""go out"" if Trump was re-elected.
""With all this pressure on you right now and you've got to win you just have to"" he told Harris. ""I
really believe we're in for the darkest skies on the planet like the sun?s literally going to go out. God

125,Conservative,FOX News,"Obama stumping for Harris in key battleground charges Trump 'will
makes problems worse'
PITTSBURGH ? On the campaign trail for the first time for Vice President Kamala Harris former
President Barack Obama repeatedly took aim at former President Trump on Thursday at a large
rally in Pennsylvania arguably the most important battleground state in the 2024 election.
Pointing to the margin-of-error race between Harris and Trump with less than four weeks to go until
Election Day and early voting already underway across much of the country Obama acknowledged
that ""this election?s going to be tight because there are a lot of Americans who are still struggling
out there.""
""What I cannot understand is how anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a
way that?s good for you Pennsylvania"" the former president emphasized to cheers from the crowd.
Obama referring to polls that indicate many Americans think the economy was better during
Trump?s four years in the White House than under the current administration claimed that ""the
reason some people think"" times were better was ""because it was my economy. We had 75 straight
months of job growth that I handed over to him. It wasn?t something that he did.""
TRUMP AND BIDEN TRADE FIRE AS POLITICAL STORM OVER HURRICANE RAGES
""Just in case everybody has a hazy memory? he didn?t do nothing except those big tax cuts"" which
Obama argued only benefited wealthy Americans and big businesses.
Obama who remains extremely popular with Democrats eight years after leaving the White House
argued that ""there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.""And he reiterated that ""Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about
his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.""

Obama jabbed at Trump for his constant attempts to ""sell you stuff. Who does that? Selling you gold
sneakers and a $100000 watch and most recently a Trump bible?. you could not make this stuff up.
If you saw it on Saturday Night Live you?d say ?well that?s going too far.? Well he?s doing that.
It?s crazy.""
And Obama stressed that ""we don?t need a president who will make problems worse to just to make
his own political circumstances better. We need a president who actually cares about solving
problems and making your life better and that?s what Kamala Harris will do.""
During the rally Obama also discussed manhood and had a message for male voters who may be
attracted to Trump's perceived strength.
""Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can?t always
stand up for themselves. That is what we should want for our daughters and sons.""
And he emphasized that ""is what I want to see in a President of the United States of America.""

The choice of Pittsburgh as Obama's first stop was no surprise. It's the largest city and Democratic
stronghold in Pennsylvania which is the biggest prize of the seven key battleground states whose
razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump and will likely
determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election.
Obama isn't the only former Democratic president to hit the campaign trail on behalf of the vice
president.

who later won election and re-election to the White House will stop Sunday and Monday in parts of
Georgia before heading on to North Carolina later in the week for a bus tour.

It's part of Clinton's efforts to court rural voters in the two crucial southeastern battleground states.
Obama and his wife former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Harris for president in
July five days after President Biden ended his 2024 re-election in a blockbuster announcement.
The former president made the case for Harris during a headlining address at the Democratic
National Convention in August in his hometown of Chicago saying she ""is ready for the job.""
Harris and Obama?s friendship goes back 20 years to when they met on the campaign trail while he
was running for Senate in Illinois. And Harris was an early supporter of his 2008 presidentialcampaign and even knocked doors for him in Iowa ahead of the caucus the Harris campaign noted.
While Thursday's rally was Obama's first appearance on behalf on the presidential campaign trail
he's helped raise $80 million for the Democratic nominee including headlining a top-dollar
fundraising last month in Los Angeles according to Harris aides.
Obama aides and the Harris campaign say the Pittsburg rally is the first of numerous coordinated
""get out the vote"" stops by the former president across the country in the closing stretch of the 2024
White House campaign.
They add that Obama will also sign additional fundraising emails record candidate-specific ads and
robocalls for down-ballot races.
Hours before Obama arrived in Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey became the latest Democrat in a key
Senate race that could determine whether the party holds on to its razor-thin majority in the chamber
to release a new ad featuring the former president.
Casey introduced the former president at the rally and the former president repeatedly praised the

128,Conservative,FOX News,"Piling on: A tsunami of anti-Trump pieces offer a stark contrast with
Kamala?s upbeat coverage
In just the last few days there?s been a tremendous media pile-on against Donald Trump.
Whether you think that?s warranted or not ? much of it is based on his own words ? we are back to
a Trump-centric universe. Kamala Harris is making little or no news despite such spectacles as the
Oprah show and Trump as usual is back to driving each news cycle.
I have been telling people since 2015 that negative stories are good for Trump because the ensuing
debate then unfolds on his terms. In fact he deliberately uses provocative or inflammatory language
as catnip for the press knowing that even if he?s denounced that will drive coverage for at least a
couple of days.
The vice president generally gets such favorable press that many people assume she?s got this
race wrapped up. When an NBC poll shows her leading Trump by 5 points she?s said to have the
momentum although national surveys are basically meaningless.
SCANDALS FAILED ASSASSINATIONS AND POLITICAL RHETORIC: BOTH SIDES GO HIGH
AND LOW
And a New York Times poll shows Trump leading in the key Sunbelt states that the Harris camp
hoped to pick off. He has a 5-point lead in Arizona a 4-point lead in Georgia and a 2-point lead in
North Carolina.
That?s within striking distance and in some cases a statistical tie. But the Times piece says that
many voters believe Trump ""improved their lives when he was president ? and worry that a KamalaHarris White House would not.""
That?s the thing. Trump?s already had four years in the Oval Office. And while there was no
shortage of chaos ? two impeachments January 6th ? plenty of folks remember a strong economy.
And they want more details about whether Harris would take the country in a more liberal direction
even as she puts her rhetorical focus on the middle class and small business (as well as abortion
rights).
Plus it?s hard to run as a change candidate when you?re part of the incumbent administration and
large numbers see the country as being on the wrong track.
Virtually everyone in America has a set-in-stone view of the former president. His MAGA loyalists
have been with him since he said in his first campaign that ""I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue""
and not lose support.
That takes on a more ominous tone now that Trump has barely escaped assassinaton twice ? and
after the Florida golf course attempt blamed the attacks on ""danger to democracy"" language by
Harris and the Democrats. Many in the media have made Hitler comparisons and the truth is both
sides have used incendiary language.
Sometimes Trump just resorts to trolling ? ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!"" ? to get chattering classes
chattering even though he much wanted her endorsement.
Let?s look at the coverage in recent days:
TRUMP INDICATES HE WON'T MAKE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028 IFUNSUCCESSFUL THIS TIME
The Washington Post describes ""Donald Trump?s imaginary world"" where ""Americans can?t
venture out to buy a loaf of bread without getting shot mugged or raped. Immigrants in a small Ohio
town eat their neighbors? cats and dogs. World War III and economic collapse are just around the
corner. And kids head off to school only to return at day?s end having undergone gender
reassignment surgery.
""The former president?s imaginary world is a dark dystopian place described by Trump in his
rallies interviews social media posts and debate appearances to paint an alarming picture of
America under the Biden-Harris administration.
It is a distorted warped and at times absurdist portrait of a nation where the insurrectionists who
stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 2021 to deadly effect were merely peaceful protesters and
where unlucky boaters are faced with the unappealing choice between electrocution or a shark
attack. His extreme caricatures also serve as another way for Trump to traffic in lies and
misinformation using an alternate reality of his own making to create an often terrifying ? and he
seems to hope ? politically devastating landscape for his political opponents.""
Trump also accused Tim Walz speaking positively about ""execution"" after a baby is born?though
Washington Post?s Fact-Checker says the governor never said that and that fewer than 1 percent
of abortions are performed after 21 weeks of pregnancy.
In the New York Times conservative writer David French uses self-described ""Black Nazi"" and
pro-slavery GOP candidate Mark Robinson who?s running for North Carolina governor to slam
Trump.French says he?s endorsed Kamala ""because I believe that a Harris victory gives Republicans ?a
chance to build something decent? from the ruins of a Trump defeat.
""After enduring weeks of lies about the Haitian immigrants who live in Springfield Ohio and an
entire news cycle devoted to covering Trump?s connection with Laura Loomer one of the most
overtly racist figures in MAGA America (she once spoke at a conference of white nationalists and
declared  ?I consider myself to be a white advocate and I openly campaigned for the United States
Congress as a white advocate?) ? I?m hardening my view. Trump loses now or the Republicans are
lost for a generation. Maybe more?
""This has changed the composition of the party. While many decent people remain ? and represent
the hope for future reform ? Trump?s Republican Party has become a magnet for eccentrics and
conspiracy theorists of all stripes.""
64 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE
EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE
Back at the Washington Post the Trump campaign is described as imploding:
""In a single 24-hour span at the end of last month for example he amplified a crude joke about
Harris performing a sex act; falsely accused her of staging a coup against President Joe Biden;
promoted tributes to the QAnon conspiracy theory; hawked digital trading cards; and became
embroiled in a public feud with staff and officials at Arlington National Cemetery.
""The Swift attack was especially concerning to Trump?s advisers who are worried about attractingfemale voters.""
And there are his constant tributes to ""the late great Hannibal Lecter"" the movie serial killer.
""Some campaign advisers are eager to move on from Trump?s and Vance?s unverifiable claims
about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs ? a potentially detrimental news cycle that has
stretched into its second week ? but also acknowledge that Trump rarely retreats even when it
might be politically advantageous to do so.""
The piece describes Corey Lewandowski Trump?s first campaign manager as playing a divisive
role to which he responded: ""Same old nonsense that has already been written by the Washington
Compost. Your obsession with my volunteer efforts just demonstrates your continued hatred of
Donald J. Trump and prove you will stop at nothing to try and prevent him from becoming the 47th
President of the United States.""
Post op-ed columnist Ruth Marcus says Trump is ""crossing a hazardous new line"" by saying it will
be the fault of Jewish people insufficiently grateful for his pro-Israel policies if he loses the election:
""They threaten if he does lose and especially if he continues this line of argument to unleash the
fury of disappointed Trump supporters on Jews. It does not take much to imagine the backlash and
the violence that could ensue. We Jews know something about being scapegoated?
""Trump has long had an unnerving habit of bringing up the fact of people?s Judaism ? sometimes
mistakenly ? on occasions when it seems irrelevant at best. ?Who would have thought my top guys
are Jews?? Trump observed to aides Jared Kushner Stephen Miller and Jason Miller aboard Air
Force One according to the New York Times?s Maggie Haberman. (In fact Jason Miller as he toldTrump is not Jewish.)""
By contrast a Times piece on Harris? record as a prosecutor soberly finds ""a coherent record that is
for the most part consistent. Ms. Harris seemed particularly focused on protecting the most
vulnerable victims by cracking down on violent offenders while seeking alternatives to incarceration
for less serious criminals.""

It?s not that each individual story isn?t based on reported facts. But the tsunami of anti-Trump
pieces is a reminder of how relentlessly negative his coverage is ? his supporters just don?t trust the
media ? when compared to the general praise for the Democratic nominee.

130,Conservative,FOX News,"Polling guru Nate Silver says latest polling 'pretty negative' for Harris
as Trump gains momentum nationally
Prominent elections analyst and statistician Nate Silver said former President Trump appears to be
gaining momentum in the run-up to the election calling the latest data ""pretty negative"" for Vice
President Kamala Harris in an update to his latest forecast on Sunday.
""The data continues to be pretty negative for Kamala Harris"" Silver wrote on his Substack. ""There
are now three recent high-quality national polls that show Donald Trump leading ? a difficult
circumstance for Harris given Democrats? Electoral College disadvantage? and her edge in our
national polling average is down to 1.7 points. National polls don't influence the model that much
and the race remains basically a toss-up but it?s not hard to think of reasons that Trump could win.""
Silver referenced a recent Fox News Poll which shows Trump ahead of Harris in the presidential
contest 50%-48% marking a reversal from last month when Harris had a narrow advantage. The
TIPP tracking poll also cited by Silver shows Trump overtaking Harris by a two-point lead 49% to
47%.
FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP AHEAD OF HARRIS BY TWO POINTS NATIONALLY
Silver's nuanced election forecast model still shows Harris with a narrow lead nationally with the
vice president at 48.9% and Trump at 47.2% as of Sunday afternoon. But Trump who last Sunday
was ranked 46.5% in Silver's model appears to be gaining ground.
""Starting to see some Trump leads in high-quality national polls which is certainly not a great sign
for Harris. Very close race though"" Silver wrote on X.FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP TAKES NATIONAL LEAD HARRIS LEADS BATTLEGROUND
STATES
The data guru who revealed his plans to vote for Harris last month expressed a similar sentiment in
his newsletter Sunday morning which he titled ""24 reasons that Trump could win.""
""Harris is the favorite to win the popular vote but the Electoral College bias favors Republicans by 2
percentage points. In an era of intense partisanship and close elections this is inherently difficult for
Democrats to overcome"" he listed as number one.
Other explanations on his list include inflation higher prices under the Biden administration
immigration diminishing trust in the media and Harris' past record on policy.
POLLING GURU NATE SILVER REVEALS HE'S VOTING FOR KAMALA HARRIS
""The cultural vibes are shifting to the right and the left continues to pay a price for the excesses of
2020 on COVID crime ""wokeness"" and other issues"" he lists as another potential factor.
Silver continued ""Harris ran far to her left in 2019 adopting many unpopular positions and doesn't
really have a viable strategy for explaining her changing stances.""
""Harris has been running on vibes and has failed to articulate a clear vision for the country. It might
have been a good strategy if the ""fundamentals"" favored her but they don?t.""
The latest Fox News polling shows Harris ahead by 6 points among voters from the seven key
battleground states (within the margin of error for that subsample) and the candidates are tied at49% each among voters in close counties (where the Biden-Trump 2020 margin was less than 10
points). Trump?s advantage comes from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points
in 2020 (64%-35%) than Harris has in counties Biden won by more than 10 points (58%-39%).

131,Conservative,FOX News,"Poll finds majority of Americans say they're worse off than four years
ago similar to 1992 election
With Election Day inching closer a recent survey suggested that a majority of Americans believe
they are worse off than they were four years ago.
The Gallup poll released Friday found that 52 percent of Americans said they and their family are
worse off today than they were four years ago. The Gallup poll was conducted Sept. 16-28 among
1023 Americans and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
Another 39 percent said they were better off while 9 percent said they felt the same now as they did
back then.
Gallup noted that these results are most similar to their 1992 survey ? when then-Gov. Bill Clinton
defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush.
FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP AHEAD OF HARRIS BY 2 POINTS NATIONALLY
The responses varied on the person's party affiliation.
About 72% of Democrats say they were better off in 2024 than 2020 according to the survey. The
numbers were much lower for independents 35% and Republicans just 7%.
The polling powerhouse noted that participant's response to whether they felt ""better off"" was
typically tied to the U.S. economy.
Gallup?s monthly Economic Confidence Index (ECI) which ranges from -100 to +100 was currentlyat -26 with 39 percent saying they were better off financially four years ago.
TRIO OF NEW POLLS AGREE ON WHERE TRUMP AND HARRIS STAND WITH 3 WEEKS TO
GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY
The organization has been tracking ECI's since 1992. Since the start the highest ECI score was
+56 in January 2000 and the lowest was -72 in October 2008.
Gallup noted that former President Trump's 2020 loss to now-President Biden was a ""sign that
noneconomic factors were paramount to voters that year.""
America's Economic Confidence Remains Low:
Gallup noted that the ECI has largely been negative over the past four years.
In 2022 the index registered several scores that were the worst since the 2007-2009 recession and
inflation reached highs.
During the past three years Americans have named inflation as the most important financial
problem facing their family. The survey's findings suggest that inflation is an underlying fear of many
Americans' perception of the economy ? despite the generally low unemployment and steady
economic growth.
Approximately 46 percent of Americans say their current economic conditions are ""poor"" some 29
percent described them as ""only fair"" while 25 percent said they were ""good"" or ""excellent.""Additionally 62 percent said the economy is ""getting worse"" while 32% said in the survey that it is
""getting better.""

CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" is facing more pressure to release the transcript of Bill Whitaker's interview
with Vice President Kamala Harris which aired on Monday Oct. 7.
Bari Weiss the editor of the Free Press posted to social media on Saturday and said ""60 Minutes
should release the unedited transcript of the Kamala Harris interview."" The Free Press also

CBS News has been at the center of outrage after it aired an edited clip of Vice President Kamala
Harris during its primetime ""60 Minutes"" election special Monday that was different from a preview of
the unflattering exchange she had with Whitaker that was widely panned by critics.
""Given the stakes here?a rare interview with a presidential candidate a month before a very close
election?you would think CBS would do the same. But no transcript has been forthcoming"" the Free
Press editorial read.
CBS ?60 MINUTES? AIRS TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM VP HARRIS TO THE SAME
QUESTION
The New York Post editorial board also demanded ""60 Minutes"" release the full transcript of the
interview.
""With even the Harris-Walz campaign disavowing CBS' hack editing job of Bill Whitaker?s interview
with the Democratic nominee the network?s only hope of regaining any credibility is to release thefull transcript"" the editors wrote.
""Given how awful Harris looked even after CBS chose to deceive its viewers this may well be the
last serious interview she does before Election Day: The network has a clear duty to the public to
share the whole thing"" the New York Post editorial continued.
Sen. Lindsey Graham R-S.C. also weighed in on the interview and said that the idea that the
interview may have been ""edited in a favorable way"" needed to be addressed.
""Totally agree that Vice President Kamala Harris? 60 Minutes interview transcript should be
released in its entirety. The transcript will speak for itself and there is no reason not to clear the air""
Graham added.
""If you're someone who doesn't think CBS should release the unedited transcript then you are the
problem"" OutKick's Riley Gaines said on social media.

CBS on Sunday?s ""Face the Nation"" aired a clip of the exchange between Harris and Whitaker on

""Well Bill the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by
Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things including our advocacy for what
needs to happen in the region"" Harris responded.

FIRST ON FOX: A Democratic candidate is facing criticism from his GOP opponent in a new radio
ad after he declined on multiple occasions to endorse VP Kamala Harris as he runs to represent his
deep red state in the U.S. Senate.
""I didn?t join the race to decide who the president is or to tell other people how to decide to vote for
the president"" Missouri Senate candidate Lucas Kunce told NBC?s Kristen Welker last week when
asked if he would be endorsing the Harris-Walz ticket.
Kunce who declined multiple times to endorse Harris when pressed by Welker in the interview is
now the subject of a minute-long radio ad in Missouri from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley that will run this
week mocking Kunce for not standing by the nominee of his own party.
""People are excited about voting for Kamala Harris"" a woman says to another woman in the radio

Kunce has previously declined to endorse Harris including in a recent debate which Hawley has
focused on in social media posts.
""So ?@LucasKunceMO? won?t endorse Kamala Harris"" Hawley posted on X. ""Why not? Is he

has momentum in key states
SCRANTON Pennsylvania ? With less than four weeks until Election Day in November new polls in
three crucial battleground states indicate former President Trump is making gains but he remains in
a toss-up race with Vice President Kamala Harris.
According to surveys from Quinnipiac University Harris the Democratic presidential nominee holds
a 49% to 46% advantage over Trump the Republican standard-bearer in Pennsylvania.
But the former president edges the vice president 50% to 47% in Michigan and 48% to 46% in
Wisconsin.
Harris' three-point edge in Pennsylvania is down from a 6-point lead in Quinnipiac's previous survey
from a month ago.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SHOW
The results in Michigan where Trump is up by 3 points are a switch from last month when
Quinnipiac's survey indicated Harris leading by 5 points.
And in Wisconsin where the new poll gives the former president a 2-point edge it's a slight change
from September when the vice president held a 1-point edge.

""That was then this is now. The Harris post-debate starburst dims to a glow as Harris enters the lastweeks slipping slightly in the Rust Belt"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.
Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin along with Georgia North Carolina Arizona and Nevada
had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump. And
the seven states are likely to determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.
Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin are also the three Rust Belt states that make up the
Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall.""
The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in
the 2016 election to win the White House.
Four years later in 2020 Biden carried all three states by razor-thin margins to put them back in the
Democrats' column and defeat Trump.
Both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees as well as their running mates have
made repeated stops in the three states this summer.
Trump is holding campaign events on Wednesday in Scranton and Reading Pennsylvania. And
Harris returns to Pennsylvania early next week for a stop in Erie.
Both candidates have also campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin over the past few days.

weeks to go until Election Day
With just over three weeks to go until Election Day a trio of new national polls in the White House
race suggest former President Donald Trump is erasing gains made by Vice President Kamala
Harris the last couple of months after replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket.
The surveys indicate a margin of error race between the two major party presidential nominees with
Trump enjoying some momentum in the final stretch.
Harris edged Trump 50%-48% among likely voters questioned in an ABC News/Ipsos poll down
from a six-point lead for the vice president last month.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW
According to an NBC News poll of registered voters nationwide the vice president and former
president were deadlocked at 48%. That is a major switch from a month ago when Harris enjoyed a
five-point advantage.
Additionally a CBS News/YouGov nonprobability based survey of likely voters indicated Harris with
a three-point edge over Trump slightly down from a four-point advantage a month ago.
CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION
After President Biden's disastrous late June debate performance against Trump the former
president started to open up a single-digit lead over the White House incumbent.However Biden's departure from the presidential election and the Democrats' quick consolidation
around the vice president upended the dynamics of the race.
Harris boosted by a wave of energy and excitement experienced a surge in fundraising and in her
favorable ratings which pushed her past Trump in presidential polling. The trend continued through
the Democrats' late August convention and the first and likely only debate between the two
standard-bearers in early September.
However as summer transitioned into autumn Harris' favorable ratings appear to have waned
Republicans are coming home to Trump and an already large gender gap over support for the two
nominees has widened further.
HARRIS MAKES NEW PITCH FOR BLACK MALES AMID POLLING GAINS BY TRUMP
""The Harris campaign seems to have stalled as her image has slipped and the perception of her as
being ?a second Biden Administration? persists"" longtime Republican pollster Neil Newhouse told
Fox News.
Newhouse a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns argued that Harris is ""on the verge
of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.""
While national polling is useful in depicting the state of the race the presidential election is not
based on the popular national vote and instead is a battle for the states and their electoral votes.
The latest polling in the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020

didn?t make the version that aired on Monday night and a shorter more focused answer to the

The new poll from Gallup found that 54% of Americans say Trump is more capable of handling the
economy compared to 45% for Harris. The economy ranked as the most important issue for
Republicans and for all Americans but it didn't rate in the top five for Democrats.
Veteran Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf says Democrats are simply confident in Harris' plan
to handle the economy.
""Independents are looking for a reason to vote for a candidate but they just haven't found it yet""
Sheinkopf told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Americans focus on the issue most important to
them in every election. This time it?s their pockets. And they are still feeling pain no matter what
candidates say. Time is running out for Harris to prove she can make it better.""
He went on to argue that the economy is no less politicized an issue as immigration or abortion
suggesting polarization has an outsized impact on voters' opinions on the economy.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW
For Republicans the top issues after the economy are immigration terrorism and national security
crime and taxes.
For Democrats the top issue is democracy in the U.S. followed by the type of Supreme Courtjustices a candidate would pick abortion health care and education.
Trump also holds leads over Harris on immigration (54%-45%) and foreign affairs (52%-47%). Harris
holds her own leads on the top issues for Democrats however including health care (54%-44%)
abortion (56%-40%) and climate change (61%-35%).

interviews on cellphones and landlines. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4%.
A New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday found that Harris has a slight lead

Former President Trump has narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris? small lead in the
battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin new polling by the New York Times/Siena College
finds.
Among likely voters in Michigan Harris received 48% support while Trump garnered 47% locking
the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an essential tie well within the poll?s
margin of error. Harris polled at 49% among likely voters in Wisconsin while Trump received 47%
support in the same state where polls usually overestimate backing for Democrats according to the
Times.
The Times pointed to the economy which remains the most important issue for voters as Trump?s
strength on economic issues helps him edge away at Harris? slim lead in the two northern
battlegrounds.
The new poll contrasts with August?s New York Times/Siena College survey which has Harris
leading Trump by four percentage points 50% to 46% among likely voters in the battlegrounds of
Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as well. That poll was the first conducted as the race
reshaped with Harris becoming the presidential nominee following President Biden?s July departure

Former President Trump took a double-digit lead in the betting odds over Vice President Kamala
Harris for the first time since July signaling potential momentum for the former president as Election
Day draws near.
Trump opened up a 10-point lead in the Real Clear Politics betting average on Sunday his largest
lead over Harris and the largest lead any candidate has enjoyed since the former president?s
10-point lead on July 31.
The lead comes as some in Democratic circles have attempted to quell panic within the ranks after
recent polling that has seemingly trended toward Trump with David Plouffe who served as a senior
adviser to President Barack Obama and now serves as a senior campaign adviser for Harris
appearing on the ""Pod Save America"" podcast Sunday to argue that the fundamentals of the race
have not changed.
WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW
""I think the freakout is because there were a bunch of polls I?d say in the last month that showed a
lead for Kamala Harris that was not real it?s not what we were seeing. We?ve seen this thing
basically be tied let?s say since? mid-September. So this is the race we have it?s the race we
expected I don?t think it?s going to open up for either candidate"" Plouffe said.
But the betting odds have also continued to move in Trump?s favor perhaps indicating solid
momentum for the former president outside typical public polling.
Trump at one point enjoyed an over 48-point lead in the Real Clear Politics betting average overPresident Biden on July 15 but that lead quickly began to evaporate after the president?s
announcement that he would drop out of the race and Harris? quick elevation to the top of the
Democratic ticket.

enjoyed a lead as large as Trump?s Sunday advantage.
Harris? last lead in the Real Clear Politics average was on Oct. 5 with Trump steadily gaining more

voters ""are most against"" illegal migration across the border.
""We have to have a lot of people come into our country. We just want them to come in legally
through a system because [the Biden-Harris administration] released hundreds of thousands of
people that are murderers drug dealers terrorists. They're coming in totally nobody knows who

Haitian migrants in Springfield Ohio asking the 45th president if he believes the migrants are eating
cats and dogs as he has previously cited on the campaign trail and during his presidential debate

Trump said he will travel to Springfield and provide ""a full report"" after his visit.

self-identified Hispanic voters in two key battleground states Arizona and Nevada but Trump has
made gains among younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago according to a pair of
Suffolk University/USA Today polls.
A Fox News poll published Wednesday found that Harris received majority support among
Hispanics at 52% and voters under age 30 at 54% however those stats trail President Biden?s

Trump has a two-point average over Harris overall which is a reversal from last month when Harris
had a narrow advantage.
While in Florida various recent polling found Trump leading Harris among Hispanic voters the
Miami Herald reported on Wednesday.
Trump continued fielding various questions from audience members including one female full-time
student in Florida who asked how he plans to tackle the spiraling national debt which is worrying
her.
""We have record national debt. We've never had anything like it before. We were getting ready to
start paying down debt and then we got hit with a thing called COVID or the China virus"" he
responded.
""What's going to solve the problem is growth. It's a thing called growth that nobody even talks about
from the Democrat standpoint because they don't know about growth. But we're going to bring

Former President Trump said Friday he was ""surprised"" that Vice President Kamala Harris skipped

Democratic nominee.
""I thought it was great you know it was for the Catholic Church? a lot of good people a lot of good
causes and unusually she didn?t show up. You would have thought she would have showed up last
night"" Trump said during an in-studio appearance on ""FOX & Friends.""
""We were all surprised"" he added.
TRUMP TAKES JABS AT HARRIS DURING KEYNOTE AT AL SMITH DINNER VOWS TO
CORRECT 'SERIOUS PROBLEMS' IN US
The Al Smith dinner was launched in 1946 and has raised millions of dollars for charities supporting
women and children. It has since grown to become a political and cultural hallmark of election
seasons but Harris surprised many by skipping the bipartisan political event that typically adds a bit
of levity to the campaign trail each presidential election cycle.
""I think it was terrible that she missed it because... only one person missed it in many years and
that?s Walter Mondale and he lost 49-1"" Trump said referring to how the Democrat in 1984 only
won one state in his lopsided defeat.
""FOX & Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade asked Trump why he believes Harris skipped the event
that is historically attended by candidates from both parties.""I think that she?s not competent. I don?t want to say this kind of stuff but we can?t live with this""
Trump said.
""I don?t think she?s funny"" he added. ""We can?t have her as a president she?s a Marxist. We?re
not ready for a Marxist.""

""I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was skipping the Al Smith dinner. I'd really
hoped that you would come because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. She
laughs like crazy"" Trump joked.
""If you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation I guess you should have told her
the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis and she would have been
here guaranteed. She would have been guaranteed"" Trump also quipped citing Harris? promotion
of a bail fund during the riots of 2020.
The dinner is named after the first Catholic presidential candidate Al Smith who served as the 42nd
governor of New York. He ran for president as a Democrat in 1928. Harris' snub of the historic
Catholic charity event irked New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan the host of the dinner on his
podcast earlier this week.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION
The Trump campaign in revealing its fundraising numbers said that it had $283.1 million
cash-on-hand as of the end of September. That's down slightly from the $295 million it had in its
coffers a month earlier.
The Harris campaign in its announcement last month reported $404 million cash-on-hand.
Trump's team in releasing their latest figures showcased their small-dollar grassroots fundraisingsaying the average donation they received was $60 and that 96% of their contributions were less
than $200.
""In September nearly 2.5 million donations under $200 were made. These supporters have allowed
us to bank the funds we need as we move into the campaign?s final weeks. Our momentum
continues to grow from supporters and donors across the country as we enter the homestretch
toward victory"" Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes told Fox News.
The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over
Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped
Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.
Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with
Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.
But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and
mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls
from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in
fundraising didn't last and by early July began to significantly slow down.
Biden bowed out of the 2024 race on July 21 and the party quickly consolidated around Harris who
instantly saw her fundraising soar spurred by small-dollar donations.

When asked about the fundraising deficit RNC chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital lastmonth that ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money.""
However he emphasized that ""we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message
out to all the voters that we?re talking to and feel very comfortable that we?re going to be able to
see this campaign through and we?re going to win on November 5.""
Fundraising along with polling is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's
popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used ? among other things ? to
hire staff; expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts; pay to produce and run ads on
TV radio digital and mailers; and for candidate travel.",FOX News_Trump_ups_his_ante_with_September_fundraising_haul.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Former President Trump unveiled a new policy proposal promising to eliminate sanctuary cities
throughout the country.
""Today I am announcing a new plan to end all sanctuary cities in North Carolina and all across our
country"" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Wilmington North Carolina.
The comments come as Trump has continued to hammer Vice President Kamala Harris on border
security noting her role in being appointed the ""border czar"" before the administration oversaw
record-setting illegal crossings during President Biden?s first three years in office.
ELECTION BOARD IN CRUCIAL SWING STATE ISSUES CONTROVERSIAL RULING
REQUIRING HAND COUNTING OF BALLOTS
So-called ""sanctuary cities"" or jurisdictions that have limited their cooperation with federal
immigration authorities have become controversial in recent years with critics arguing that the
existence of the cities incentivizes illegal border crossings and hampers ICE's ability to take custody
of migrants accused of committing crimes in the US.
Trump vowed to tackle that issue during his rally Saturday telling the crowd that he would ""ask
Congress to pass a law outlawing sanctuary cities nationwide and we will bring down the full weight
of the federal government on any jurisdiction that refuses to cooperate"" with U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.

'Faulkner Focus' town hall with female voters
Former President Donald Trump vowed to end sanctuary cities and restore ""normalcy"" as he took
questions from female voters concerned about a variety of issues ahead of Election Day including
the economy crime and abortion.
One woman whose son attends the University of Georgia pressed him on the issue of crime and
public safety following the murder of nursing student Laken Riley earlier this year during the
exclusive town hall Wednesday on ""The Faulkner Focus.""

""My son is a Georgia Bulldog. He was on campus the day Laken Riley was murdered"" the attendee
told the former president. ""Terrifying for all those kids right? I wanted to know? how quickly in a
sanctuary city ? like they're calling Athens Georgia ? how quickly can you remove those threats to
our societies that our children can go out on a run as they rightfully should be able to do in a park in

""We can do things in terms of moving people out. We can move them out of the sanctuary cities.
We're going to end all sanctuary cities in the United States and we're going to go back to normalcy""
he pledged in response.
""And we're going to have law and order.""
Crime consistently ranks as a top issue for Republican voters nationwide falling right behind theeconomy which polls indicate is the largest motivator as constituents head to the ballot box.
Recent polling showed former President Trump has a nine-point lead over Vice President Kamala
Harris when it comes to handling the economy the single most important issue for voters going into
the 2024 presidential election.
The Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans say Trump is more capable of handling the economy
compared to 45% for Harris. The economy ranked as the most important issue for Republicans and
for all Americans but it didn't rate in the top five for Democrats.
One woman asked him about the rising cost of living for families and his plans for the child tax
credit.
""I'm a single mom to two kids here and just in three and a half years my child tax credit has
decreased by 80%"" one attendee told Trump. ""Last year I had broken my neck and I tried applying
for any kind of assistance and was denied because I did not make less than $700 a month... what
kind of realistic changes that do you think you can provide [to] single parents married parents any
kind of parent to just simply afford children in today's world with the way things are here?""
""I gave you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country"" Trump said in response. ""Larger than
the Reagan cuts. Larger. I understand exactly what you're saying. We're going to readjust things so
that it's fair to everybody because it's really not fair to everybody? We're going up higher but we're
also going to readjust because you have to make some readjustments.""
CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION""It's unfair to some people and we're not going to have that"" he continued.
Another town hall attendee Pamela originally from California asked the former president about
abortion a topic that ranks among the most important for some women as they head to the ballot
box.
""Women are entitled to do what they want to and need to do with their bodies including their
unborn. That's on them regardless of the circumstance. Some are necessary to save their own
lives"" she said. ""Why is the government involved in women's basic rights?""
""For 52 years this issue has torn our country apart"" Trump responded. ""Every legal scholar the
great ones every lawyer ? but the Democrats the Republicans the liberals and conservatives they
wanted it brought out of the federal government and brought back to the states for a vote of the
people. And like Ronald Reagan I believe in the exceptions for rape incest life of the mother.""
""I strongly believe? you have to follow your heart. Some people don't. It's a very small percentage
but you have to follow your heart"" he continued. ""But you have the exceptions. But what we were
able to do was through the courage of six Supreme Court justices. We were able to do this after
years and years of turmoil.""
Abortion has ranked as a top issue for Democrats heading into Election Day alongside democracy
education and health care.
Trump also holds leads over Harris on immigration (54%-45%) and foreign affairs (52%-47%). Harris

support for VP Harris: 'Very excited'
LAS VEGAS - Two members of the local Las Vegas culinary union which endorsed Vice President
Kamala Harris for president spoke to Fox News Digital about why they are supporting Harris and
knocking on doors to get her elected in a battleground state where unions play a significant role in
voter turnout.
Lino Paredes a banquet steward at Wynn Las Vegas and a culinary union member for six years
told Fox News Digital shortly before he and several hundred other union members went out to knock
on doors for Harris and other Democrats that he had his first child right before COVID lockdowns
began and believes she will put him in the best position to buy his first home.
""I will be a first time home buyer I want to keep my son in a house?I don?t want to be rent to rent
that?s one of the biggest issues right now here I would say in Nevada"" Paredes said adding that he
supports Harris? proposed program to help with down payments for houses.
""And then with these prices you know price gouging from these corporations. They?re not helping
us at all so we?re asking and we?re looking for someone that is willing to help?she?s a very
talented woman and so I think that she will lead this country.""

Paredes one of roughly 60000 culinary union workers went on to say that there are ""too many
things"" to list that he likes about Harris and said ""there?s a lot of things she?s offering us.""
""She knows the pain that we're going through with talking to our family"" Paredes said. ""There's a lotof things that we want to give to our family that we can't at this moment because of this price
gouging from these companies and I think she will understand us better.
""I don't think the other person ever standing at a grocery store counting how much money he had.
I?m pretty sure he had other people go buy his groceries right?""
Paredes also credited Nevada's Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen currently in a tight race against
Republican challenger Sam Brown as someone who is ""fighting toe to toe"" for union workers which
has inspired him to canvass for Democrats.
Suldenil Alvarez a guest room attendant at Caesar's Palace and a culinary union member for seven
years also told Fox News Digital she hopes to be a first time homeowner and believes Harris can
best help her do that. Additionally she spoke about the importance of abortion access.

166,Conservative,FOX News,"Vance Walz spar over abortion and immigration in first and only VP
debate
Sen. JD Vance of Ohio the Republican vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz
the Democratic vice presidential nominee faced off Tuesday night in their first and only debate
sparring over issues like foreign policy border security abortion and climate change and introducing
themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.
Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier but with former President Trump and
Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots Nov. 5 the
stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues
facing the nation.
WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE
TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS
CBS News anchors Norah O?Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York
City Tuesday night which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs on a
day that began with nearly 50000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and
ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at
the Jewish State.
The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel
on Iran.
A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate pausing and stumbling over his words as he
spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering thequestion Walz took a shot at Trump.
""What?s fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter"" Walz said pointing to
Trump?s debate performance against Harris last month. ""It?s clear and the world saw it on that
debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not
what we need in this moment.""
But Vance in his first answer defended Trump saying Trump ""delivered stability to the world and
he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""
""People were afraid of stepping out of line"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people
to fear the United States you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they
got out of line the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""
CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION
As for a preemptive strike Vance said ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep
their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are when they?re fighting the
bad guys.""
Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal
saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump?s fickle
leadership"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""
Vance fired back.""You blame Donald Trump but who has been the vice president for the last 3½ years? And the
answer is your running mate not mine"" Vance said.
Vance again defending Trump said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""
""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump?s tweets but effective smart diplomacy and peace through
strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has
already done it once before.""
Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""When was the last time that an American president
didn?t have a major conflict break out?""
""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president"" Vance said.
The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border a top issue for voters.
Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris while touting
Trump?s plan to secure the border.
VANCE WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE
THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'
But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.
""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said no told
[lawmakers] to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue"" Walz said. ""What wouldDonald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""
On the same topic moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family
separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.
""We have 320000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost"" Vance
explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them hopefully are at homes with
their families.
""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this
country is unfortunately Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow
Americans to remember when she came into office she said she was going to do this. Real
leadership would be saying 'You know what I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald
Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""
Walz pushed back saying children have not been used as ""drug mules"" and defending Harris
saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human
trafficking and drugs.""
Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield Ohio saying he
had demonized them.
""Look in Springfield Ohio and in communities all across this country you've got schools that are
overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally
unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans""
Vance said.At that point moderators tried to correct Vance but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed
back reminding the moderators that they said they would not be fact-checking the candidates.
The moderators said many Haitian residents in Springfield Ohio have temporary legal status.
Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""
While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process the moderators spoke over
him sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone
as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.
""We have so much we have to get to. Thank you so much for explaining the legal process"" Brennan
said before asking O'Donnell to ask the next question.
As for the issue of abortion another top issue for voters this cycle Walz maintained that he and
Harris are pro-choice while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning
the American people's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us.""
""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a
Republican Party to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility
treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies"" Vance said. ""I want to
make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And
I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options
right now.""
Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issueof abortion to the states while supporting exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother.
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP
DEBATE
""The proper way to handle this as messy as democracy sometimes is is to let voters make these
decisions"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what
makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse ? and let's be honest ? sometimes a very very
messy and divided country.""
Meanwhile the moderators switched to questions of leadership pressing Walz on whether he was
actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests as he had previously claimed.
A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and
was not there until later that year.
And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.
Vance said at the time he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that
turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""
""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages rising take-home pay an economy
that worked for normal Americans a secure southern border. A lot of things frankly that I didn't
think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah when you screw up when you misspeak when you get
something wrong and you change your mind you ought to be honest with the American people
about it"" Vance said.Meanwhile Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the part of the debate focused on gun
violence when he learned Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.
Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""
""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that. Christ have mercy""
Vance said.
The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.
""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make
the windows stronger and of course we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the
idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys it just doesn't
fit with recent experience"" Vance said.
Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.
""Even though we have a high gun ownership rate in the country there are reasonable things that we
can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have
some of these weapons out there it just doesn't make any sense"" he said.
Vance was pushed on past comments in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020
election results on Jan. 6 2021.
Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy"" saying he believes""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""
""But unfortunately it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk
about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of
disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens"" Vance
said.
Walz redirected the discussion to Jan. 6 2021 blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly
denying the events of that day.
""I will tell you this that when this is over we need to shake hands this election and the winner
needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart"" Walz said.
Vance replied saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique
threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""
""As we have done for 250 years in this country we are going to shake hands after this debate and
after this election. And of course I hope that we win and I think we're going to win"" Vance said.
""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and
he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""
But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country Democrats protested the results of
elections.""
""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because
the Russians bought like $500000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long timeand if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election I'm on board"" Vance said.
""But if we want to say as Tim Walz is saying that this is just a problem that Republicans have had I
don't buy that governor.""
As the debate came to a close Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United
States.
""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy.
She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that all the
while asking everyone join this movement. Make your voices heard.""
Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.
""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once
before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or
vote for Tim Walz I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.""
Walz entered the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.
According to the latest Fox News national poll Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable
rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory at 38%-50%
favorable/unfavorable.

Harris? running mate began his answer by highlighting the differences between the Trump and

""I was asked to be governor of this state when Donald Trump was president and when Joe Biden
was there. And I watched Donald Trump dismiss the COVID pandemic. I watched him drive an

protecting reproductive care.""
The host revised the question asking ""So it makes me wanna ask you do you think that Biden?s
done everything right?""
Walz replied by saying either way Biden?s intentions have always been good.
""Well look I don?t know if any of us do everything right"" he began. ""But I can tell you he?s done
everything in the best interest of the American public.""
He continued ""He?s asked for answers. And I think you know ­? reevaluated afterwards. And I
think if your values and the judgments you?re making and the ethical decisions you?re making
he?s done that.""
""And I again have seen the difference that it made especially during the COVID pandemic of what

Newsom. Walz made similar comments at an earlier fundraiser in Seattle as well.
While running for president in 2019 Harris said she was ""open"" to the idea of abolishing the
Electoral College. However according to campaign officials pressed on the issue following Walz's
remarks eliminating the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote is not an official position
of Harris' current campaign.
Fox News Digital reached out to representatives for Walz repeatedly to inquire whether he still
supports replacing the Electoral College with a national popular vote particularly after his campaign
came out against it. A response was never received but the Harris-Walz campaign did release a
statement to certain news outlets suggesting Walz's remarks were intended to express support for
the Electoral College process.

""Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College and he is honored to be
traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket"" aHarris campaign spokesperson said in a statement sent to select media outlets like CNN and USA
Today. ""He was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win
270 electoral votes. And he was thanking them for their support that is helping fund those efforts.""
Debate over whether a national popular vote should replace the Electoral College surged in 2016
when Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote cementing his victory despite losing the popular
vote to Hillary Clinton. ""I think it needs to be eliminated"" Clinton told CNN after her 2016 loss to
Trump. ""I?d like to see us move beyond it yes."" Clinton made similar calls earlier in her career as
well.
Just last month Democratic Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin suggested there could be deadly
consequences for Americans if the Electoral College was not done away with. Raskin said a national
popular vote was a far better option than the current ""convoluted antique obsolete system from the
18th century which these days can get you killed as nearly it did on Jan. 6 2021.""
NEBRASKA GOP SENATOR OPPOSES ELECTORAL COLLEGE CHANGE THAT MAY HAVE
HELPED TRUMP WIN RE-ELECTION
The Electoral College has been something that both Republicans and Democrats have tried to do
away with in the past but contemporary calls for its abolition surged among Democrats after
Clinton's loss. The process was established by the nation's Founding Fathers seen as a
compromise between the election of president by vote in Congress and election by a popular vote of
qualified citizens. Electoral College votes of which 270 are needed for any presidential candidate to
win are allocated based on the Census. The process effectively allows voters in states with lower
populations to have a similar impact on the election as those voters living in higher population
densities. The Electoral College is also thought to be a protective measure against super thinmargins and excessive recounts.
In May 2023 as governor Walz signed a broad ranging election bill that included a provision to
allocate the state's electors based on who receives the most votes nationwide even if it doesn't
match the outcome in their state. The measure known as the ""National Popular Vote Interstate
Compact"" has been supported by 17 states and the District of Columbia but will only take effect
after all the states that have signed on have a total electoral vote count of 270. Right now those
supporting the reform only have 209 according to CBS News.

Polling from the Pew Research Center released last month showed a majority of Americans favor
moving away from the Electoral College. Since 2016 the sentiment has steadily increased and
according to Pew more than 6 in 10 Americans today prefer the national popular vote over the
Electoral College.
Jason Snead executive director of Honest Elections Project Action a nonprofit that advocates in
favor of retaining the Electoral College argued Walz ""said the quiet part out loud"" when he insisted
the Electoral College should be eliminated.
""Democrat leaders don't think they should have to campaign in places like Michigan and North
Carolina they want California and New York to decide every election"" Snead argued. ""There is a
pattern here. Democrats claim to love democracy then set their sights on any institution that stands
between them and political power: the Supreme Court the Senate filibuster and the Electoral
College.""",FOX News_Walz_silent_on_support_for_eliminating_Electoral_C.pdf.pdf,news_articles

favorite
Former President Trump the Republican presidential nominee has opened up a sizable advantage
in the election betting odds in recent weeks giving Americans a new way of trying to piece together
what might happen come Election Day.
""More than two billion dollars have been bet on the election already"" Maxim Lott who runs
ElectionBettingOdds.com told Fox News Digital.
The comments come as Lott?s website which uses data from five different betting sites to display a
betting average shows Trump has a 58.5% chance of winning the presidential election as of
Monday.
Lott?s website isn?t the only one tracking the betting odds with popular sites such as
RealClearPolitics which has become known over the years for tracking polling averages joining the
fray.
TRUMP OPENS UP LARGEST BETTING LEAD SINCE DAYS AFTER BIDEN'S DROPOUT
Like ElectionBettingOdds.com the RealClearPolitics betting average shows Trump as the favorite
with a 59% chance to win the election as of Monday.
Trump?s chances of winning the election have dramatically risen over the last few weeks with his
Democrat opponent Vice President Harris being the betting favorite on RealClearPolitics as
recently as Oct. 4. But Trump took the lead the next day and hasn?t looked back eventually rising
to the nearly 20 percentage-point advantage the former president enjoyed on Monday.For Lott looking at betting averages gives people a much clearer picture of what the most likely
outcome of the election is compared to trying to piece together polls.
""These are really accurate they?re more accurate than just trying to look at polls or especially more
accurate than listening to pundits bloviating"" Lott said.
""[The bettors] look at all sorts of historical data they look at trends"" he added. ""I find the percent
more useful than the polls.""

Lott who previously served as a program executive producer for the Fox Business Network also
noted that people risk their own money to make a bet on an outcome creating a market that has the
ability to ""discipline people"" who get it wrong.
""If you?re not very smart or very biased you?re going to lose your money pretty quickly and then
maybe you won?t bet again next election"" Lott said.
While betting on elections is newer than more well-known gambling pastimes such as sports betting
and casino games Lott said the market has become robust enough to offer election followers a
glimpse into what the most likely outcome will be.
""Last cycle we had more than a billion dollars traded. That?s still [not] that much if you compare it to

As for Trump?s lead Lott said it likely reflects an end to the ""honeymoon period"" Harris enjoyed
after being elevated as the Democrat nominee noting that Trump had risen to around 70% likely to
win the election before President Biden dropped his bid for re-election and has bounced back into
the lead once again.
""Things have kind of reverted back to the mean where ? it is a tough cycle for Democrats with things
like inflation and immigration and so maybe for a couple months people were like ?Oh Harris this

170,Conservative,FOX News,"White House releases medical report on VP Kamala Harris
The White House on Saturday released a report from Vice President Kamala Harris' doctor
declaring her to be in ""excellent health.""
The report which was previewed by a senior Harris campaign aide comes as the 59-year-old
Democratic nominee seeks to contrast herself with former President Trump 79 who has not made
recent health disclosures.
""Vice President Harris remains in excellent health"" wrote her Army physician Dr. Joshua R.
Simmons. ""She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the
duties of the Presidency to include those as Chief Executive Head of State and Commander in
Chief.""
VP HARRIS RELEASING DETAILED MEDICAL REPORT CHALLENGING TRUMP TO DO THE
SAME
Advisers to Harris encouraged her office to release her medical history and health information to put
a spotlight on Trump's health and mental acuity since the 78-year-old Republican nominee would
be the oldest president at the end of his potential second term according to a senior aide.
President Biden  81 withdrew from the 2024 presidential election in July amid pressure from the
Democratic Party given concerns over his advanced age and visible fatigue. Since then Democrats
have sought to go on offense against Trump with what was once their election vulnerability.
During an August interview with CBS News  Trump insisted that he would ""gladly"" release his
medical records noting at the time that he had a ""perfect score"" on a recent medical exam. He hasnot yet done so.
READ THE REPORT BELOW. APP USERS: CLICK HERE
The letter from Dr. Simmons calls Harris' most recent medical exam in April 2024 ""unremarkable.""
The vice president has no major health issues and ""maintains a healthy active lifestyle despite her
busy schedule"" including daily exercise. Harris eats a ""very healthy diet"" does not smoke and
drinks ""only occasionally and in moderation"" according to her doctor.
TOP 5 FRIENDLIEST MOMENTS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' MEDIA BLITZ: ?THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
""Vice President Harris is a healthy 59-year-old female who has a medical history notable for
seasonal allergies and urticaria"" the letter states. Urticaria is a common skin condition that can
cause itchy red raised bumps or welts to appear on the skin. It can be triggered by certain foods
medications or stress. Harris takes Allegra to manage her allergies and urticaria and for the past
three years she has undergone allergen immunotherapy (ATI).
Other details from the report include that Harris is nearsighted and wears corrective contact lenses
that she has a family history of colon cancer (her mother died of colon cancer in 2009) and that she
is ""up to date on all preventative care recommendations including colonoscopy and annual
mammograms.""
WHY TRUMP IS HEADED INTO ?THE BELLY OF THE BEAST?: THE STREATEGY BEHIND HIS
BLUE STATE STOPSThe decision to release Harris' medical information comes after a New York Times report asserted
that Trump has not been transparent with his own health even after a would-be assassin's bullet
grazed his head at a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania this past July.
Trump did not release his medical records in his first White House campaign in 2016 the report
notes. Neither did the Trump White House release accurate updates on his condition after a 2020
COVID diagnosis with reports detailing that the president was more sick than his doctors said in
public according to the report.
""In 2024 days before becoming the official Republican presidential nominee for the third time he
was grazed by a would-be assassin?s bullet yet his campaign did not hold a briefing on his
condition release hospital records or make the emergency physicians who treated him available for
interview"" the report said. It goes on to quote several medical experts who raise concerns that
Trump could enter the Oval Office in a second term with several ""potentially worrisome issues.""

The last health update from Trump came in November 2023 when his personal doctor Bruce
Aronwald said in a letter Trump's ""overall health is excellent.""
""His physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional""
Aronwald wrote.
In response to a request for comment Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to the
letter released by Aronwald and reports from former White House doctor Rep. Ronny Jackson
R-Texas who treated Trump after the failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.""President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician as well as detailed
reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt"" Cheung said.
""All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief. He has
maintained an extremely busy and active campaign schedule unlike any other in political history
whereas Kamala Harris has been unable to keep up with the demands of campaigning and reveals
on a daily basis she is wholly unqualified to be President of the United States. Her schedule is much
lighter because it is said she does not have the stamina of President Trump. Polls are reflective of
this.""",FOX News_White_House_releases_medical_report_on_VP_Kamala_H.pdf.pdf,news_articles

says: She 'doing historically well'
White women could be the key voting bloc that secures the 2024 Election for Vice President Kamala
Harris CNN data reporter Harry Enten argued on the network on Tuesday.
Recent polls show former President Trump gaining ground with Latino and Black voters. However
the largest group of likely voters White women have shifted away from Trump in battleground
states according to Enten's analysis.
An aggregate of polling indicates that Harris is underperforming among White men women of color
and men of color when compared to voters who supported President Biden in the 2020 Election.
However Harris is outperforming among White women to ""a historic degree"" Enten said.
Trump won this voting bloc by seven points in 2020 according to post-election surveys taken at the
time. Since 2012 the Republican presidential candidate has won the White women vote. But with
less than three weeks to go until the November election Trump now holds just a 1-point advantage
among this group the data guru said.
?WHITE WOMEN FOR KAMALA? SPEAKER TELLS VIEWERS TO NEVER CORRECT BLACK
WOMEN: ?PUT OUR LISTENING EARS ON!?
""He?s doing the worst ? if this holds ? for a GOP candidate this century among White women""
Enten continued.
Harris' lead with White women could ultimately help her win the election he argued since they
make up 36% of the electorate according to his analysis.""Yesterday we were talking about those massive gains that Donald Trump was making among Black
men Black women. But the bottom line is they actually make up a considerably smaller portion of
the electorate than White women do"" Enten said.
""So when we?re talking about 5 6-point shifts 7-point shifts in Kamala Harris? direction [among
White women] we?re talking about that among a major part of the electorate and that can actually
move the overall electorate more than ginormous shift among a considerably smaller part of the
electorate"" he said.

Polls suggest abortion is driving these voters to support the Democratic ticket this election he said.
According to a New York Times/Siena College survey cited by CNN abortion is the top voting issue
for 27% of women across the swing states of Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where over
80% of voters are White.
""I think what we?re talking about here is after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022 White women in
the suburban areas in these key battleground states have very much turned against Republicans
and we?re seeing in the polling right now because Kamala Harris is doing historically well at least
this century for a Democratic candidate among White women. And of course they make up a very
large portion of the electorate"" Enten said.

As the negative media onslaught against former President Donald Trump grows louder he is taking
on the fact-checkers.
What is fascinating in the coverage is that the journalists and organizations that do this are treated
like prophets handing down the tablets from Mount Olympus. There is no hint not a whiff that they
might sometimes be wrong or engaging in overkill.
AS A CAUTIOUS KAMALA LOSES MOMENTUM DEMOCRATS ARE PANICKING OVER A
TRUMP WIN
In a new Gallup poll 36% said they had ""no trust at all"" in the media while just 31% said they found
the media to be fair and accurate a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount."" The distrust was far higher among
Republicans than Democrats.
Now skeptics will say that Trump tells a lot of falsehoods some decisions are clear-cut and it is
worth trying to hold him accountable. I know these folks work hard having done a lot of it myself but
sometimes the fact checks are contentious in gray areas or even over something Trump said
jokingly at a rally.
I don?t even have to make the argument that Vice President Kamala Harris draws overwhelmingly
favorable coverage. Now that she?s come out of her cocoon in the light of slipping polls sitting
down today with Fox?s Bret Baier she has a short period of time to break through after walling
herself off. With Democrats in panic mode she is also ramping up her rhetoric against the former
president. And we?re seeing an explosion of columns and segments on what Harris needs to do to
turn her campaign around ? free advice from the media.OBAMA ACCUSES BLACK MEN OF SEXISM AMID RELUCTANCE TO SUPPORT KAMALA

As the Washington Post notes Trump complained about fact-checking by ABC in his debate with
Harris (when it did seem like 3 against 1). Additionally in turning down ""60 Minutes"" he cited the
program?s tradition of fact checking. (He also drew flak from CNBC yesterday after backing out of
an interview.)
If there?s one moment that crystallizes the media opposition to Trump it?s his appearance before
the National Association of Black Journalists. The opening question was a diatribe about how he
was a horrible racist building up to why any Black voters should support him. The Harris
appearance by contrast was practically a lovefest.
Behind the scenes there was a tense hourlong impasse in which Trump refused to take the stage if
there would be fact-checking. When he finally took the stage the group lied and blamed the entire
delay on audio problems.
TRUMP COUNTERS HARRIS MEDIA BLITZ BY RIPPING BOB WOODWARD HOWARD STERN
AND HER HURRICANE BRIEFING
How is it that Trump says things that trigger journalistic outrage sometimes with incendiary
language but raise no doubts among many Republicans? The New York Times offers this
explanation ""One of the more peculiar aspects of Donald J. Trump?s political appeal is this: A lot of
people are happy to vote for him because they simply do not believe he will do many of the things
he says he will.""It?s how they rationalize his rhetoric by affording him a reverse benefit of the doubt.""
A 40-year-old Detroit publisher was quoted as saying he did not believe Trump would purge the
federal government and hire only election deniers: ""It could just be for publicity just riling up the
news.""
Whether Trump wins or loses he will have the support of roughly half the country. In 2020 that
amounted to 73 million voters.
Yet most of the mainstream media with some exceptions have never really understood the
unshakable bond between Trump and his supporters. Most tend to travel in circles where allowing
him to be a ""danger to democracy"" is unthinkable. He has made inroads among Black voters
especially Black men some of whom say the Democrats make promises at election time and then
forget about their community.

Trump on Saturday will headline a rally in Coachella a city in California's Riverside County

The stop in Coachella may also benefit Trump with Latino voters ? who have been trending towards

178,Conservative,FOX News,"'Kind of disgusting': Harris makes move that could backfire in critical
swing state
Vice President Kamala Harris? decision to hit the trail with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney could
backfire in Michigan where Cheney is hugely unpopular with a critical voting bloc in the swing state.
""It was surprising for us as Arab Americans to have Kamala Harris bringing someone whose family
name always reminds us of war crimes in the Middle East"" Hamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib told
reporters in an online call Monday. Liz Cheney's father Dick Cheney was vice president under
former President George W. Bush and was a strong proponent of the 2003 Iraq War.
The comments come as Harris embarked on a three-state battleground tour with Cheney a
Republican who has long sparred with and opposed re-electing former President Donald Trump.
That tour landed in southeast Michigan in Royal Oak where Cheney joined Harris for a town
hall-style event and implored moderate Republicans to join her in supporting Harris.
""I would say I don't know if anybody's more conservative than I am. And I understand the most
conservative value there is is to defend the Constitution"" Cheney told members of the audience.
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: VOTER OUTREACH BALLOT EFFICIENCY AND A LITTLE
HOUSEKEEPING
However while Harris is hoping the former Republican lawmaker could help her grab extra voters in
what promises to be a razor tight race for Michigan Cheney?s visit to the state drew ire from a
group typically prone to supporting Democrats.
""The Arab American community as I see it are very disappointed"" Ghalib who has now endorsedTrump in the election said. ""To bring this person to our backyard to remind us all of the tragedies
that happened in the Middle East is something that tells us that there would be more wars coming if
Kamala Harris is elected.""
Harris? struggle with the Arab American population in Michigan predated her rise to the top of the
ticket with a movement out of Dearborn Michigan originally gaining traction to resist the re-election
of President Biden over dissatisfaction with the administration?s handling of the conflict in Gaza.
Many leaders of the community were willing to give Harris a chance when she replaced Biden as the
nominee over the summer but the disconnect between her and the critical bloc has seemingly
grown in the months since.
A TRUMP MYSTERY MAKES ELECTION OUTCOME EVEN MURKIER
""It is very very disappointing and kind of disgusting to bring somebody to bring Cheney over here""
Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi said on the same call. ""There?s no peace in the family.""
Trump has seemingly gained steam in Michigan in recent weeks with the most recent Real Clear
Politics Polling average showing him up 1.2 points in the state. While it is still a tight race Trump's
lead marks a dramatic shift from the end of August when Harris had a 2.2 point lead over the former
president. Meanwhile the state has shifted from ""lean Democratic"" to ""toss up"" in the latest version
of Fox News' Power rankings.
Both mayors have thrown their support behind Trump in the upcoming election while Ghalib argued
that Harris bringing Cheney to the state will only serve to alienate more members of the Muslim
community.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

179,Conservative,FOX News,"'Ruining our car industry': Biden-Harris EV regs prove flashpoint in
Michigan Senate debate
Former Rep. Mike Rogers R-Mich. and Rep. Elissa Slotkin D-Mich. traded blows on electric
vehicle mandates and border security during their Senate debate in the critical swing state of
Michigan.
""It's ruining our car industry"" Rogers said of mandates related to buying and producing electric
vehicles (EV) during Monday?s debate starting one of the most heated exchanges of the event.
""You're promoting Chinese technology in America.""
The two candidates in Michigan?s critical Senate race have sparred over the issue of EV mandates
throughout the campaign highlighting how critical the issue is in a state that will play a major role in
deciding the presidential election and control of the federal legislature.
Rogers has attempted through two debates in the race to tie President Biden and the Democratic
Party?s support for EVs to Slotkin who has countered that her support for the technology will
ensure that Michigan remains competitive in the future of auto manufacturing.
MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATES CLASH ON NATIONAL SECURITY IMMIGRATION AND
ABORTION
Rogers said Democrats such as Slotkin are ""killing the car business"" when it comes to promoting
EVs accusing his opponent of voting for a ""mandate"" on EVs ""at least three times.""
While there has been no mandate that Americans must purchase EVs the Biden administration has
pressed emissions standards that could force automakers to ensure that up to two-thirds of theirnew vehicles sold are zero-emissions by 2032. According to a report in the Detroit Free Press
Slotkin voted against legislation that would have blocked the new standards but has expressed
openness to rewriting them if they would hurt U.S. automakers.
""I want that manufacturing here. I don't care what you drive I want to build them"" Slotkin said during
Monday?s debate.
Candidates blame each other for border crisis
The two candidates also attempted to cast blame on the other for the situation at the southern
border with Slotkin accusing Rogers and Republicans of a campaign to kill Biden?s border
legislation before it could get through Congress.
""What's going on at the southern border is a symptom of a broken immigration system"" Slotkin said
accusing Republicans of using the ""border as a political issue than actually do the real work and get
things done.""

CHARGE
Rogers instead blamed Democrats on the issue calling Biden?s legislation a ""terrible bill"" that would
have allowed for continued legal crossings while Slotkin questioned how Rogers could claim to
know better on the issue than the national Border Patrol union which threw its support behind the
deal.
Tense exchange over abortionThe debate also highlighted the two candidates' competing views on abortion with Slotkin doubling
down on campaign ads that have accused Rogers of supporting several pieces of anti-abortion
legislation.
""He has shown us who he is don?t trust him on this issue"" Slotkin said.
MICHIGAN DEM LAUNCHES ANTI-EV AD IN BID FOR SENATE RACE AFTER VOTING AGAINST
A BIPARTISAN PUSHBACK ON MANDATES
Rogers countered by arguing that he supported leaving the question of abortion to the voters in
each state promising not to do anything in the Senate that would undo the will of voters in Michigan
who voted to make abortion a right in the state.
""I won't do anything when I go back to the United States Senate to undo the vote of the people""
Rogers said.
Candidates disagree on gun control mental health
Another tense exchange saw the two candidates trade blows over gun reform with Slotkin
acknowledging her own history with firearms but calling for tougher legislation to ""go after the
number one killer of children in our communities.""
""It's really really easy to understand why politicians in the face of murdered children don't do
anything. They don't do it because they receive campaign donations and they're scared"" Slotkin
said. ""They're scared because they don't want to lose their election and it's terrible.""THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN:
TUDOR DIXON
Rogers countered that the issue mostly centered on the country?s struggles with mental health and
that ""banning guns isn?t going"" to solve the issue.
Promises to put more money back in voters' wallets
Inflation and the economy were another major issue during the debate with Rogers appealing to
voters to remember if they were better off under the leadership of Republicans four years ago.
""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" Rogers asked. ""My opponent voted 100% with
Biden-Harris (Vice President Kamala Harris who is the Democratic presidential nominee) on all of
the things that have raised your prices.""
Slotkin responded by pointing to her support for bringing supply chains back to the U.S. which she
argued would help bring prices down. She also hit Rogers on his lack of support for allowing the
government to negotiate lower pharmaceutical prices something she said would help alleviate the
pressure on middle-class families.

The Senate race in Michigan will be one of the closely watched nationally and features one of the

favor. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average Slotkin currently holds a slim 1.9 lead

Even so the race has shifted significantly since Sept. 19 when Slotkin held a 5.1 advantage over

RACE
Since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July Harris has enjoyed a
wave of momentum and enjoyed a surge in fundraising. In the all-important cash dash Harris andthe DNC appear to hold a large advantage over Trump and the RNC.
And that's helped bolster what was already a very impressive ground game organizational
advantage the Democrats held over the Republicans.
""We started laying the foundation well before 2024 by investing in our ground game"" Harrison
highlighted. ""We have been on the ground since the earliest days of this campaign getting our

But Whatley wasn't phased.

noting that Trump was outraised in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.
The RNC chair emphasized that ""we have the resources we need to get our message out to our
voters and to every voter. I feel very very comfortable about the campaign plan.""
And while the Harris campaign and allied groups have outspent Trump and his aligned groups in the
ad wars Whatley pointed to the former president's ability to capture free media.""Donald Trump is out there talking every single day to the voters in a way that only he can. He can
generate news. He can go out there and generate social media hits. He can communicate directly

he said.
Veteran Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducted the Fox News Poll along with longtime
Republican pollster Daron Shaw said with four weeks to go ""my expectations of plausible
outcomes range from a narrow Electoral College victory for Trump to a modestly more comfortable
victory for Harris.""

But while Harris holds a slight two-point edge in an average of the national surveys Shaw noted that

Veteran political scientist and New England College president Wayne Lesperance said that ""this
presidential contest is shaping up to be one of the closest in history with the results likely to be
slow-coming.""
And longtime Republican consultant Matt Gorman a veteran of numerous GOP presidential
campaigns highlighted that ""we?re slated for the tightest race since 2000.""

""It?s imperative that she continues to get in front of swing state voters and she could afford to do

endorsing Harris
Vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester D-Mont. is continuing to defend his decision not to endorse in the 2024
presidential race ahead of his tough re-election but the Democrat's opponent suggests his ""record""
signals support for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Tester recently revealed that he would not be making an endorsement in the presidential race in
order to focus on his re-election despite being a key player in Harris' recruitment to the Senate.
Tester served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) from 2015 to
2017 leading the efforts of the campaign arm to elect Democrats to the chamber when Harris first
announced her senatorial aspirations. And after Harris launched her California Senate bid the Los
Angeles Times reported in January 2015 that according to an adviser Tester was one of the
players who encouraged her to run.
Asked again about withholding an endorsement Tester's response was that he would work with or
hold accountable whichever presidential candidate gets elected.
KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE
""Unfortunately my opponent would rather talk about a national race that will be decided by the
people of Montana. Whoever gets elected to the U.S. president I can guarantee you one thing just
like all previous ones I?ll work with them when they?re doing good things for Montana and I?ll hold
them accountable when they?re not"" Tester told MTN News in an interview.
NEW YORKER SPENDS LARGE PART OF KAMALA HARRIS ENDORSEMENT REBUKINGBIDEN: HE ?STOOD IN THE WAY?
Tester endorsed Harris when she was selected as President Biden's 2020 running mate. ""My friend
@KamalaHarris is a proven fighter and an excellent pick for Vice President. As VP I'm confident
she will continue to fight for working families across this country. Looking forward to supporting her
and @JoeBiden in November"" Tester wrote in an August 2020 post on X formerly known as
Twitter.
Montana Republican nominee and Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy who endorsed former President Trump
in the presidential race suggested that Tester's voting record is his endorsement for Harris.
""Jon Tester votes with Kamala Harris 95% of the time. His voting record is his endorsement of the
failed Harris agenda and every time Montanans needed him to stop the insanity in Washington he
was the deciding vote to further her progressive liberal agenda"" a spokesperson for Sheehy for
Montana told Fox News Digital.
""That same agenda has made costs for things like groceries and gas skyrocket it?s brought us
record high inflation and has given us a wide-open southern border that has brought crime and
deadly drugs into our communities. Tester also voted to allow benefits for illegal immigrants paid for
by the American taxpayer ? a hallmark of the Harris agenda. We can?t afford to re-elect Jon Tester
because his voting record in Washington proves he?s changed and is and will continue to support
the radical America Last agenda.""
Tester is running for re-election in red state Montana a race that could likely determine which party
controls the chamber and recent polling and political forecaster predictions suggest that Sheehy is
currently leading the race just weeks before Election Day.A recent AARP survey found that Sheehy is leading by six percentage points in a head-to-head
matchup against Tester. His lead against Tester widened to eight points in a multi-candidate field
that included the state's Green Party and Libertarian candidates.

""60 Minutes"" correspondent Jon Wertheim defended CBS News during an appearance on

is much ado about nothing and calls to release a transcript were above his pay grade.
Dakich pointed out that CBS News has faced significant backlash after airing two different answers
Vice President Kamala Harris gave to the same question after a much-criticized answer used to
promote the interview on ""Face the Nation"" was cut from the network?s ""60 Minutes"" broadcast.
""Oh man we?re going there already"" Wertheim the executive editor of Sports Illustrated
responded when Dakich pressed him about it. ""You know you do these interviews and ?60
Minutes? segments in about 13 minutes and 10 seconds right? You spend hours sometimes days
and days with the subject you boil it all down to 13 minutes. Things are edited in every story.""
CBS '60 MINUTES' AIRS TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM VP HARRIS TO THE SAME
QUESTION
""I don?t quite know the details but I don?t really get it. I mean anytime ? you wrote something for
Sports Illustrated sometimes the online version isn?t exactly the same as the version that?s in the
magazine"" he continued. ""Some things that might be in the promo aren?t going to make the piece.""
Wertheim reiterated that he doesn?t ""get"" the backlash which has included former President Trump
scolding the network and a formal complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission.
""When would you do a story and not edit? Not make choices and not make sort of selectivequotes? you sit there in a locker room with your tape recorder and not everything an athlete says is
going to make it into the story"" Wertheim said adding ""I don?t make these decisions but I feel like
something?s missing here because when in media do you not make editorial choices?""
Harris was mocked by conservatives on social media when footage of her offering a lengthy ""word
salad"" was aired by CBS Oct. 6 on ""Face the Nation"" to promote the ""60 Minutes"" sit-down after Bill
Whitaker asked why it seemed like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn?t listening to
the United States. However the vice president?s lengthy answer didn?t make the version that aired
on Monday Oct. 7 on ""60 Minutes"" and a shorter more focused answer to the same question was
shown instead.
CBS NEWS IN TURMOIL AS MULTIPLE CONTROVERSIES ERUPT AT THE NETWORK
Interviews are frequently edited to save time but airing two different answers to the exact same
question has raised eyebrows. Dakich asked Wertheim if CBS News should release the full
transcript in order to clear things up.
Wertheim appeared to think for a moment before saying ""I don?t know I think there are things that
get said in a transcript with a subject ? it?s not going to make sense in context. It?s kind of not the
way the game is played.""
Wertheim who said he doesn?t speak for ""60 Minutes"" then said he doesn?t know the ""ground
rules for this stuff"" at CBS.
""This is above my pay grade"" he said.""More than anything honestly I?m just sort of confused by it all"" he added. ""When would you ever
work on the assumption that everything you do is going to make it into the piece?""
Dakich said critics believe CBS and ""60 Minutes"" are trying to make Harris ""look good"" and cutting
her longer answer from the primetime broadcast would have helped achieve that goal.
PRESSURE MOUNTS ON CBS NEWS TO RELEASE FULL KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW
TRANSCRIPT
""There wasn?t anything doctored you just make editorial decisions to fit into a time"" Wertheim said
adding that he lets the subjects of his sports reporting re-answer questions if they felt they misstated
something.
CBS News has not offered an on-the-record explanation or responded to requests to release the
unedited video.

One of your most effective points in the first debate was in your closing statement when you asked
Kamala why she did not initiate any of her special programs as vice president. The question should
next time be aimed directly at her as it puts her in a real bind; either she can admit that as VP she
did very little or throw Joe under the bus and claim he stymied her initiatives. It is a win-win for you.
In addition the question drives home the larger point of tying Kamala to the Biden administration.
Harris needs badly to show something to the public to give them a reason to think she would be
different than the last four years. She is desperate not to run as the pseudo-incumbent all that ""turn
the page"" and call for change stuff she borrows from Obama 2008 and you should be equally
desperate to hold her to what has and has not taken place these last four years. Remind the public
the Biden-Harris administration created all the major issues raised (economy immigration) during
the previous debate.On the economy remind people food prices rose 5.3 percent under your administration while in
Biden?s first three years food prices increased conservatively by a whopping 20.3 percent.
Almost half of Americans think the U.S. economy is in a worse state now than it was when
Biden-Harris took office in January 2021. The Census Bureau released an update earlier this month
on income poverty and health insurance in the United States. Income-wise many Americans were
still not better off than they were in the last pre-pandemic year 2019 nor necessarily even than they
were in 2020. In the latest Times/Siena poll Harris trailed you by 13 points on the economy the
issue that matters most to voters. It?s one of the main reasons why she?s tied and not ahead of you
in the race overall.
So create a simple app that calculates what groceries would have cost four years ago. People plug
in their current register tape numbers and are told what a similar basket of goods would have cost
under your administration.

It actually looks like someone had once done most of the heavy lifting on this one already. One of
your official Super PACs launched a website (now defunct) named ?Biden-Mart? that let users
compare Trump-era grocery prices to current costs under Joe Biden?s administration.
Biden-Mart.com published by the Make America Great Again Inc. PAC featured an interactive
grocery checklist encouraging users to ?check off the items? to compile your weekly grocery list and
see how much more expensive your bill has become under Joe Biden.? There were over two dozen
common food staples to choose from including coffee dairy products and a variety of differentfruits and vegetables. For example a two-pound bag of apples two pounds of ground beef seven
lemons one gallon of milk and one pound of sugar and coffee each totaled $30.07 ? a killer 57.1
percent increase from the $19.14 it cost during your administration. Egg prices remain 72 percent
higher today than when Biden entered office in early 2021. Biden-Mart used data mostly from the
United States Department of Agriculture so it should be relatively quick to reconstruct the app.
It will remind people during your first three years in office food prices rose by 5.3 percent as wages
soared past them at 12.7 percent growth. Wages have not kept up with food prices during
Biden-Harris. It is one thing to talk about inflation as this percentage or that quite another to reach
into a voter's pantry and hit them with a specific dollar amount.
As even the Harris-favoring New York Times wrote ?Optimistic words and some admirable
proposals aren?t enough to overcome the discontent and anger that a large majority of Americans
feel about the economy.? Harris word-checks ?freedom? with abandon but never mentions freedom
from debt from living paycheck-to-paycheck because of inflationary practices under Biden-Harris.
Harris as vice president cast the tie-breaking vote for the measure economists point to as the
cause of inflation?the ironically named ?Inflation Reduction Act.? Remind the people they deserve
better.
The Biden-Harris administration admitted some 21 million aliens dramatically more than under the
Vietnam War evacuation and the Mariel Boatlift combined. Will you Kamala admit another 21
million under a Harris administration? Talk about what that number means; in 2021 there were
around only 3.66 million live births in the United States.
Focus on narrative personal stories about ordinary Americans unfairly burdened by unchecked
migration. Never mind the dogs and cats; Springfield Ohio a semi-rural town of only some 60000people ended up playing host to 15000 Haitian immigrants. They overwhelmed the city?s medical
and social services systems to the point where the governor had to send in state troopers and
millions of dollars as a palliative. The poverty rate for the city is 22.7 percent well-above the state
average of 13.4 percent. Fatal car accidents in Springfield increased fourfold last year due to a
surge of Haitian migrants unfamiliar with American driving rules.
Or mention the slaughterhouses and meat packing plants that employ migrant children. Talk about
individual victims of migrant street crime in New York City showing photos of a zombie Midtown
overtaken by the homeless and drug users. The latter ties also in Harris?s time as a prosecutor and
attorney general in California where same as in New York many criminals who should have been
taken off the street were given bail or simply released in the wake of ?woke? law enforcement
post-Floyd.
Whenever possible follow Ronald Reagan who at the close of his 1980 debate against President
Jimmy Carter asked simply ?Are you better off today than you were four years ago?? It is a rare
American who will be able to answer unequivocally ?yes.? The ones who say ?no? are likely to be
among middle-of-the-roaders who can swing your way in November.",The American Conservative_A_Pre-Debate_Letter_to_Donald_Trump.pdf.pdf,news_articles
186,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Can Trump Achieve a Diplomatic Breakthrough With Iran?
The Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency Donald Trump recently made several
statements suggesting his readiness to engage in a more constructive relationship with Iran than
has been the case for the better part of the last 45 years since anti-American revolutionaries
toppled the regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
In mid-August Trump said he hoped for ?friendly relations? with Iran. In early September at the
Economic Club of New York he spoke about how Washington?s addiction to sanctions weakens the
dollar?s hegemonic position in the world by forcing countries like Iran Russia and China to ditch it in
favor of alternative financial arrangements undermining America?s global position.

Trump?s narrative on this point is sensible. To get a sense of the perspective one only needs to
look at the expansion of BRICS initially a grouping comprising China Russia Brazil India and
South Africa. Since 2024 Iran United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia Egypt and Ethiopia have joined
it. Turkey?a NATO ally?has applied to join. Reportedly more countries have expressed interest in
exploring the idea including some of those with which the U.S. has close security relationships
such as Azerbaijan.
While at first sight BRICS may not amount to more than summitry and earnest communiques about
the advent of a multipolar world one key incentive for countries to consider joining are the
prospects?so far mostly tentative?to find alternatives to dollar for their trade and investments in
order to shield themselves from the weaponization of dollar for geopolitical purposes by Washington.
Considering that BRICS after its expansion now represents 45 percent of the world population
Trump?s concerns about the U.S. sanctions overreach are fully justified.The question: Can he pull off a genuine change in the U.S. approach? Iran a country with which the
U.S. has the most entrenched and seemingly intractable conflict could be a good litmus test for
Trump?s abilities.
The precedents do not invite much optimism. During his first term Trump wrecked the nuclear deal
with Iran known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that was delivering on its objective
to keep Iran away from the nuclear bomb. He imposed new sanctions against Iran as part of his
?maximum pressure? campaign devised in theory to deliver a ?better deal? with Tehran but in
reality thanks to ultra-hawkish advisers like Mike Pompeo and John Bolton amounting to no less
than pursuit of a regime change in yet another Middle Eastern nation.
Trump did try occasionally to reach out to Iran. As Trita Parsi the executive vice-president of the
Quincy Institute reminds us in 2017 and 2018 he sought meetings with Iran?s then-President
Hassan Rouhani and through the mediation of the Republican Senator Rand Paul Foreign Minister
Javad Zarif.
Advertisement
Those meetings however never materialized as Tehran did not respond to Trump?s entreaties.
That happened primarily not because of some ideological animus towards the ?Great Satan? but
because the policymakers in Tehran calculated that accepting a meeting would validate the
?maximum pressure? strategy and allow Trump to brag about its success without removing any
sanctions. There was no reason why Tehran was going to hand this diplomatic victory to Trump for
free.The situation was further complicated by Trump?s order to assassinate General Qasem Soleimani
the influential commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps?s elite Al-Quds force. Given
Soleimani?s status as a de-facto operational leader of the Tehran-led ?Axis of Resistance? in the
Middle East dealing with Trump poses seemingly insurmountable political and ideological
challenges for Tehran.
Yet despite this Tehran may have incentives to test Trump?s intentions should he win the elections
in November. For one thing the lesson of the JCPOA?which Trump destroyed but his Democratic
successor Joe Biden failed to restore?is that the deals concluded with the Republicans have a
better chance of standing. Contrast the fate of the JCPOA with that of the Abraham Accords signed
under Trump?s watch and built upon by Biden.
The lesson is that the Republicans are willing to renege on the deals made by the Democrats but
the Democrats are happy to live with the deals made by the Republicans.
For Trump however to get a ?yes? for an answer from Tehran would take more than occasional
vows on the campaign trail and belief in his own transactional abilities. A skillful patient diplomacy is
needed.
First Trump needs to entrust his Iran policy to those few Republicans who like Senator Paul and
Colonel Douglas McGregor seem open to dealing with Tehran. Exponents of the America First
foreign policy such as the vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance and prospective national security
adviser Elbridge Colby do display some pro-restraint tendencies but those are mostly focused on
Russia and Ukraine. On Iran they mostly stick to a conventionally hawkish Washington consensus.
However they are unlikely to push for Pompeo and Bolton-style regime change policies.Then Trump needs to use the momentum from the reformist administration in Tehran showing signs
of readiness of re-engaging with Washington. With the veterans of nuclear diplomacy such as the
foreign minister Abbas Araghchi back in charge lines of communication could be re-established.
The current government in Tehran strives to diversify the nation?s foreign policy and recent
tensions with Russia over diverging interests in the South Caucasus show the limits of the one-sided
?turn East? orientation pursued by the previous administration. Above all Iran?s dire economic
situation requires some form of sanction relief from which the U.S. businesses could also benefit.
That last point is surely not lost on Trump when he complained in 2016 that as a result of the
nuclear deal under President Barack Obama it was the European and Chinese not American
companies that benefited.
Finally Trump should take advantage of Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris?s
unwise strategy of trying to out-hawk Trump on Iran by criticizing his ?feckless policies? in office
(meaning alleged failure to respond militarily to Iran?s strikes on the U.S. bases in Iraq themselves
undertaken as a retaliation for Soleimani?s assassination). He should leave the repetition of the
hawkish Washington boilerplate platitudes to his opponent and instead run as a pro-peace
pro-business candidate committed to extracting the U.S. from the pointless enmities and endless
wars.",The American Conservative_Can_Trump_Achieve_a_Diplomatic_Breakthrough_With_I.pdf.pdf,news_articles
187,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Congress MIA on Possible U.S. War with Iran
When asked what the U.S. response might be to the Iranian airstrikes on Israel last week National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan suggested it was Washington?s war too.
?We have made clear that there will be consequences severe consequences for this attack and
we will work with Israel to make that the case? Sullivan said during a press briefing at the White
House.

To which Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) fumed on X: ?Work with Israel? Excuse me the Constitution
requires you to work with Congress!?
Two days later Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) weighed in on the same platform. ?Any offensive action by
the U.S. against Iran would be unconstitutional without a Congressional Declaration of War? he
wrote.
Nevertheless as talk turns to the kind of retaliation Israel might deliver against Iran for its 200
ballistic missile attacks (which Israel and U.S. both claim were ?ineffective?) it is becoming clear
that the U.S. might play a direct role. That was not refuted this week when Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin called his counterpart Yoav Gallant (he was to meet with him in Washington today but
the confab has been postponed): ?I confirmed the United States commitment to Israel?s security
and shared that the United States is well postured across the region to defend Israel and protect
U.S. personnel and facilities.?
Even more to the point CENTCOM commander Gen. Erik Kurilla met with Gallant in Israel and hadthis to say:
We discussed ongoing Iranian-backed threats to the region and efforts to stabilize the region
ensure Israel?s security and deter Iran?s malign and reckless activities Before departing I
reiterated the strength of our ironclad military-to-military commitment between CENTCOM and the
Israeli Defense Forces.

In back-to-back radio interviews with Brian Thomas on October 2 Massie and Andrew Napolitano
expressed their concern that we may wake up tomorrow and find that the Biden administration had
made the executive decision to take the nation to war. ?You won?t see a declaration of war because
Congress doesn?t want to embarrass itself. It?ll just look the other way while the president does
whatever the hell he or she wants. And that?s to me just frightening? charged Napolitano.
Unfortunately given the circumstances and recent history Napolitano is probably right?if the
administration decides to let Israel drag the U.S. into direct military action with Iran there is little
Congress or anyone else will be able or better yet willing to do about it.
The executive branch has been consolidating and reaffirming its war powers over the last several
decades and has not been constrained by the Constitution nor the War Powers Resolution which
was passed by Congress in 1973 to limit the president?s ability to make unilateral decisions to take
and keep the country at war.
Experts point to successive presidents who have used existing Authorizations for the Use of Military
Force (AUMFs) passed for the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars to justify military operations over the last20 years including recent airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. They say presidents
have abused their powers under Article II of the Constitution to enter into hostilities which Congress
under the WPR say he can only do to respond to ?a national emergency created by attack upon the
United States its territories or possessions or its armed forces.?
Whether the Houthi attacks on global shipping which the Yemeni militants say will continue until
there is a ceasefire in Gaza are an imminent threat to the U.S. is up for debate. The White House
claims that it is a threat to the global economy regional security and once the U.S. Navy got
involved and had been sporadically fired upon American security interests too. The administration
has invoked its Article II powers and filed required reports to Congress under the WPR for different
strikes including several against militants in Iraq and Syria over the last year.
This allows the administration to keep ?stopping and setting? the 60-day clock for Congressional
action or as experts call ?salami-slicing.? The AUMFs have been used as ancillary statutory
authorities if that clock runs out as well. This was done in the Trump administration too.
?Finding the statute? is what former State Department legal adviser Brian Finucane calls it.
?Through creative interpretations of the War Powers Resolution and the 2001 AUMF and now the
2002 AUMF as well this White House like its predecessors has been able to involve and keep U.S.
troops in wars that Congress never specifically authorized? he wrote back in January.
Other than lambasting the president in the media during the initial Yemen airstrikes in January
members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have not raised the issue in terms of forcing a vote
under the WPR to declare war?or not?in the current Middle East hostilities. (An attempt by Paul
however to bring home the approximately 900 U.S. troops in Syria using the WPR failed to pass the
Senate in December.)Outside organizations warn that ?a new endless war? will be Biden?s legacy signing a letter to the
president on October 3: ?We urge you to recognize and respect that Congress has not authorized
military force against Iran or militias backed by Iran and that any potential military action against
Iran could only proceed following a debate and passage of a war authorization before entering our
troops into any imminent hostilities in the region.? (Disclosure: The letter was signed by the author?s
employer the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft).
But without a forceful response from Congress ? and even then ? it would seem war is the
prerogative of the executive today. Constitutional law expert Bruce Fein balks at the irony.
?In 2007 while seeking the Democratic Party nomination as president Biden shrieked on Chris
Matthews?s Hardball that he would lead the charge for President Bush?s impeachment and removal
from office if he attacked Iran without a prior declaration of war? Fein told The American
Conservative in an email.
?Biden days ago attacked Iranian missiles in collaboration with Israel with the Navy?s AEGIS
ballistic missile defense an act of war not authorized or declared by Congress. Under Biden?s own
impeachment standards loudly trumpeted in 2007 Biden himself has committed an impeachable
offense? he added. ?Congress should be demanding that Biden testify before Congress to explain
the constitutionality of what he has already done in light of Biden?s 2007 statements as President
Ford was summoned to explain to the House Judiciary Committee his pardon of former President
Nixon. Congressional complacency with presidential usurpations of its war power is stunning.?
The complacency is helped along by the fact that both chambers are out of session until after the
election. Numerous offices contacted by TAC on both sides of the partisan aisle Monday either didnot respond or said they could not comment on the possibility of the U.S. going to war without
Congressional authorization.
?In essence we were under the leadership of a king? said the radio host Brian Thomas. ?In that
regard no accountability no representation by our elected officials no say in the matter. We?re
going to drop bombs. This has come up in the context of us doing just random missile strikes and in
any given land we find somebody that we don?t like.?",The American Conservative_Congress_MIA_on_Possible_U.S._War_with_Iran.pdf.pdf,news_articles
188,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Democrats Are a Major Threat to Free Speech; Trump Isn?t
The Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has threatened to sic the Justice Department
on social media platforms that ?profit off hate.? That was in 2019. Her vice presidential running
mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has said that ?there's no guarantee to free speech on
misinformation or hate speech.? That was in 2022.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has said that the government needs to figure out how to
?rein in the media environment.? That was in 2021. Hillary Clinton the former secretary of state and
2016 Democratic presidential nominee has suggested that Americans who share misinformation
should be criminally charged. That was a month ago. The former Secretary of State John Kerry the
2004 Democratic presidential nominee has worried about the First Amendment being a ?major
block? to stopping ?disinformation.? That was two weeks ago.

When you bring up top leaders in the Democratic party openly calling for government censorship to
the average Democratic voter you usually immediately hear about the Republican presidential
nominee Donald Trump?s many affronts to free speech. Trump has threatened to jail those who
burn the American flag. He has threatened to deport pro-Palestinian protesters. Trump recently said
that CBS News should lose its broadcast license for biased and deceptive reporting.
You can find Republican voters and some leaders who might agree with Trump?s anti-free speech
stances. It?s hard to imagine the Supreme Court agreeing with any of them. Still it?s Trump at his
worst and his critics are right to highlight his attacks on the First Amendment.
But there?s also this Trump who said in September ?I will bring back free speech in America?. Iwill sign an executive order banning any federal employee from colluding to limit speech and we will
fire every federal bureaucrat who is engaged in domestic censorship under the Harris regime.?
He was describing precisely the kind of government censorship that Harris Walz Ocasio-Cortez
Clinton and Kerry say is now needed. Trump campaign surrogates and former Democrats Robert
F. Kennedy Jr. and the former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have made pushing back against the
Democrats? much-desired censorship regime a primary part of their efforts. The former presidential
candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and X?s billionaire owner Elon Musk have said they joined Team
Trump in part over the same free speech worries.
In the only 2024 vice presidential debate Walz doubled down on his stance that ?misinformation? or
?hate speech? is not protected speech comparing it to shouting ?fire? in a crowded theater.
Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH) the Republican vice presidential nominee replied ?Governor Walz
mentioned yesterday you can't shout fire in a crowded theater. That line is from a disgraced
Supreme Court opinion one that has been overturned.?

?It?s used to justify censorship? Vance correctly added.
?I genuinely think this is one very big difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump? Vance
said. ?I will die fighting to defend their right to speak their mind even if I disagree with it. Every
single person in this room agrees with that because we believe in free speech.?
?A lot of Americans are sick of the censorship? Vance continued. ?They?re tired of being told by
their government to shut up. We believe in persuading our fellow Americans not silencing them.?Vance?s remarks and sentiments in defense of free speech do not exist in today?s Democratic
party. If progressives of old once prided themselves as ?card-carrying ACLU members? most
mainstream Democrats today either are trying to find workarounds to the First Amendment or simply
pretending that its protections somehow don?t apply to their more recent imaginings of
?misinformation? ?disinformation? or ?hate speech? despite the Court ruling that such speech is
protected.
Somewhere between Trump?s victorious campaign in 2015 and 2016 and now Democrats decided
that the old liberal concept of free speech was too dangerous in the age of MAGA. They quickly
switched gears and today you won?t encounter many Democratic leaders or voters who find the
notion of the government censoring speech they don?t like bothersome. Columns are now regularly
written by left-wing writers and intellectuals disparaging free speech as ?right-wing? and
condemning the Constitution and the First Amendment as ?dangerous.?
Despite Trump?s anti-free speech rhetoric which deserves attention and condemnation his 2024
Republican coalition is largely a pro?First Amendment bulwark against a Democratic party eager to
erase that particular constitutional protection.
Not perfectly but institutionally today?s Republican Party is the free speech party.
Institutionally today?s Democratic Party is the party that is against free speech in the way
Americans have historically understood it.
It?s not me a writer telling you this. Democrats themselves from the very top of their party as cited
here keep telling us this over and over and few to none in their constituency find this position theleast bit controversial. It?s been normalized.
That?s scary.
All attacks on free speech should be taken seriously. But particularly those made by those in power

189,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Grand Strategy Must Begin with Homeland Defense
Foreign policy experts have been debating which of America?s geostrategic interests in Asia
Europe or the Middle East should take precedence. But recent polling tells us that the American
people have a totally different top priority. They want our leaders to focus more on the security of
our U.S.?Mexico border.
Both the former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris have a track record on border
issues. Trump increased border protections and reduced the inflow of illegal aliens. He is credible
when he promises a strong border and massive deportations of illegal aliens. The Biden-Harris
administration caused and encouraged the current invasion-like 10 million border encounters with
people from over 160 countries. As border czar Harris did nothing to address this emergency. Her
only border plan is to revive a proposed bill that failed to pass the Senate and was rejected by the
speaker of the House.
Advertisement
It is clear what caused America?s border problem. Right after the inauguration the Biden-Harris
administration stopped the construction of the Trump border wall and announced a complete
reversal of his border policies. Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH) put it well during the vice-presidential
debate: ?We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she
wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. Ninety-four executive orders suspending
deportations decriminalizing illegal aliens massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our
system that has opened the floodgates.?
The problem is multi-faceted and grave. It affects the safety of Americans. Just last week
Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted that as many as 425000 illegal alien criminals arecurrently in the United States. Over 60000 have been convicted of assault and16000 of sexual
assault. Nearly 57000 are guilty of crimes involving dangerous drugs.
Because of the collapse of order at our southern border our border agents are spending their time
processing the relentless flow of illegal aliens instead of stopping the flow of illegal drugs. As a
result fentanyl from Mexico has caused the death of over 100000 Americans and can be rightly
viewed as a weapon of mass destruction wielded against our fellow citizens.
The FBI thinks that a large number of public safety and national security threats are at elevated
levels all at once. Topping the list are a terrorist attack and cartels pushing fentanyl ?into every
corner of our country.?
These risks and others are exacerbated when millions of illegal aliens are released into the country
without proper background checks. Just last month a report by the House Judiciary Committee
documented that ?during fiscal year 2024 Border Patrol has encountered tens of thousands of
illegal aliens nationwide from countries that could present national security risks including 2134
Afghan nationals 33347 Chinese nationals 541 Iranian nationals 520 Syrian nationals and 3104
Uzbek nationals.? Even worse the report also reveals that ?the Biden-Harris Administration
released into the United States at least three illegal aliens with potential ISIS ties after the aliens
used the Administration?s CBP One app to arrive at a port of entry and be processed into the
country.? In this environment there is an increased risk of another 9/11-type attack.
Advertisement
The immigration problem also has a prosperity downside. There is ample evidence that adding to
the workforce large numbers of low-skilled immigrants reduces the wages of working classAmericans. In the 1990?s Milton Friedman remarked ?You cannot simultaneously have a welfare
state and free immigration.? Today?s immigration crisis proves him right when illegal aliens are a
net fiscal drain and a heavy burden on social services like schools and health care. Furthermore
Americans have to pay more to buy a home because the housing demand by the millions of illegal
aliens has pushed up prices.
In a seminal article entitled ?The Return of Peace Through Strength? the former National Security
Advisor Robert O?Brien argues that President Trump?s purposeful and decisive foreign policy
advanced peace for America and the world. He contrasts this with the Biden-Harris administration?s
weak policies that encouraged bad actors to start hot wars in Europe and the Middle East and to
sharply increase tensions in Asia. The weak border policy is just par for the course: ?The Biden
administration?s inability to secure the southern U.S. border is perhaps its biggest and most
embarrassing failure.?
America needs a second Trump presidency to implement urgently a decisive and comprehensive
border security plan. Among the actions to be considered should be the following.
First restart comprehensive work on the wall because walls are effective. Numerous countries
around the world have reached the same conclusion. The Biden administration itself begrudgingly
approved limited wall construction in Texas and Arizona. Even Harris herself flip-flopped on building
a wall and is now in favor of it.
Second reinstate the Trump-era ?Remain in Mexico? policy that the Biden-Harris administration
recklessly abandoned. Asylum claimants who illegally cross the southern border should not be
paroled into the U.S. and given a court date in several years as the Biden-Harris administration has
been doing. They should be processed at the U.S. border and asked to wait in Mexico for action ontheir asylum claim. This policy would discourage those who are not legitimate asylum seekers
seeking protection from persecution but simply economic migrants trying to game the system.
Government data show a success rate as low as 15 percent for those claiming asylum.
Third the United States should take the fight to the Mexican cartels. These criminal organizations
are increasing their wealth and power by smuggling into our country people and drugs especially
the deadly fentanyl. The stronger the cartels are the more they harm the security and prosperity of
the American people.
Proposals in the House and the Senate would designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist
organizations. There are many issues to consider in this matter but arguments in favor outweigh
those against. Importantly it would give the U.S. government tougher monitoring and sanctioning
tools.
Trump declared his willingness if asked by Mexico?s president to get the U.S. military involved in
fighting the drug cartels. He observed that ?the cartels have become so large and powerful that you
sometimes need an army to defeat an army.? He tweeted ?If Mexico needs or requests help in
cleaning out these monsters the United States stands ready willing & able to get involved and do
the job quickly and effectively.? This would be a repeat of the successful Plan Colombia of the early
2000?s during which the United States helped the Colombian government financially and militarily to
defeat its drug cartels.
Some believe that the U.S. must go further and attack the cartels even without permission from the
Mexican government. They argue that these narcoterrorist groups are more like ISIS than like the
American mafia. Because they are killing Americans with their drugs we should confront the cartels
as national-security threats not manage them as a law-enforcement matter. If in the 1990s the U.S.had taken this approach with Islamic terrorists like Al-Qaeda we might have prevented 9/11. We
cannot afford another such mistake. Action in this direction is a joint resolution proposed by Reps.
Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and Michael Waltz (R-FL) giving the president authority to use the U.S.
military against Mexican cartels trafficking in fentanyl.
The chaos at our southern border and the resulting grave harm to the American people must move
to the top of the list of national security concerns for the next U.S. president. Getting results will take
toughness and persistence. Whom do you trust with this job Trump or Harris?",The American Conservative_Grand_Strategy_Must_Begin_with_Homeland_Defense.pdf.pdf,news_articles

forgo security relationships with other nations. These proposals are the same as those of Putin and

Trump?s running mate Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH). Vance?s plan which consists of a ceasefire
the creation of a demilitarized zone along current frontlines and the scrapping of Ukrainian plans to
join the EU or NATO has been attacked by many on the left as a ?surrender.?

ability to be a nuclear power that is one of my highest priorities.?
In the interview Harris also indicated support for both the ?One China? policy and military aid to
Taiwan although she did not state whether she believes the U.S. should defend Taiwan in case of
conflict. The vice president said
I?m not going to get into hypotheticals but listen we need to make sure that we maintain a ?One
China? policy but that includes supporting Taiwan?s ability to defend itself including what we needto do to ensure the freedom of the Taiwan Strait.
Harris?s foreign policy views have been heterogenous. As a senator in 2019 she voted in favor of a
resolution asking the president to end U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen against the Houthis

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down Wednesday with MSNBC?s Stephanie Ruhle in Pittsburgh
for her hotly anticipated first solo interview as the Democratic presidential candidate.
While she touched on hot-button topics like immigration and abortion Harris primarily touted her
economic program which she unveiled earlier Wednesday at a rally in Steel City emphasizing
measures on housing and employment.

Although the interview was hailed as a victory by her own camp Harris foundered on a number of
questions including on the Teamsters? non-endorsement and resorted to apparently evasive
generalities.
Following the pre-taped interview Ruhle herself expressed dissatisfaction about Harris?s evasions
in comments to Nicolle Wallace her fellow MSNBC host highlighting a question she asked about
how she was going to get CEOs to pay a higher share of taxes without causing capital flight.
?Well listen I work with a lot of CEOs I spend a lot of time with CEOs? replied Harris. ?They agree
people should pay their fair share. They also agree when we look at a plan such as mine investing
in the middle class investing in new industries investing in entrepreneurs and the overall economy
is stronger and everyone benefits.?

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down Wednesday with FOX News? Brett Baier for a tense
interview.
The interview the first that the vice president has done with an outlet considered hostile to her
campaign was widely seen as a liability for the Democratic candidate.

Watching Baier's Harris interview. Thoughts: Harris is getting her first taste of what it's like to be a
conservative interviewed by the mainstream media and she doesn't like it one bit. She started
reasonably strong but the longer it goes on the more she's falling apart ? Megan McArdle

Harris dodged several questions on the subject of immigration. ?We have a broken immigration
system that needs to be repaired? Harris replied to a question asking how many illegal aliens had
entered the country since Biden took office. She likewise avoided answering a question about
whether she regretted Biden?s administration to termination of the Trump-era ?Remain In Mexico?
policy.
Baier pressed Harris on whether she still holds to her 2019 positions of supporting free tuition
drivers? licenses and free healthcare for illegal immigrants. ?Listen that was five years and I?ve
made it very clear that I will follow the law I have made that statement over and over again and as
vice president that is exactly what I?ve done? Harris told Baier. She forcefully repudiated her
former view that illegal border crossing should be decriminalized.?I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I?ve not done that as vice president and I
will not do that as president? Harris said.
Harris attacked the former President Donald Trump throughout the interview. ?I do believe that the
American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has
come out of Donald Trump they are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a President
who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen out country? Harris told
Baier.
Harris also doubled down on her comments that Iran is the chief adversary of the United States. ?I
will tell you most recently whether it was in April or in October and in several hours on each
occasion that Iran posed a threat to Israel I was there I was recently in the situation room in the
most recent attack working with the heads of our military and doing what America must always do
to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself.?

all of his intended questions.",The American Conservative_Harris’s_Fox_News_Interview_Panned.pdf.pdf,news_articles
194,Conservative,The American Conservative,"J.D. Vance?s Point of Departure for Peace in Ukraine
Ukraine?s President Volodymyr Zelensky recently spoke before the UN General Assembly and had
meetings soliciting support from President Joe Biden Vice President Kamala Harris and allegedly
even the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Nevertheless whether help is
forthcoming or not the war appears to be stalemated with no end in sight.
The Republican vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance may have earlier hit upon a viable policy
proposal. True Vance?s proposal started out shakily by saying that the United States? continued
support for the NATO alliance hinged on the European Union not regulating Elon Musk and his
social media platform X. Vance argued ?So what America should be saying is if?NATO wants us to
continue to be a good participant in this military alliance why don?t you respect American values
and respect free speech.? Elon Musk may very well have good free-speech arguments with the
European Union over his platforming of Donald Trump but linking US foreign policy with the issue is
a mistake; it reeks of special pleading for a quirky billionaire who is a supporter of the presidential
candidate.
Advertisement
During the same interview however Vance suggested a proposal to end the war in Ukraine worth
discussing: that the fighting stop where both sides? troops are currently on the battlefield and a
fortified demilitarized zone set up to prevent Russia from invading again. Ukraine would be
guaranteed its sovereignty in exchange for its territory occupied by Russia and its neutrality?that is
it would not be admitted to NATO. Finally Vance argues that Germany would need to fund
Ukraine?s reconstruction.
At the very least Vance?s proposal should be a jumping-off point to a more realistic discussion ofan end to the Ukraine war which has been devastating to Ukraine and increasingly costly to Russia
(an estimated 600000 casualties). Putin?s naked aggression against a non-threatening Ukraine
must be vigorously condemned and it is understandable that Ukraine wants all its territory back. Yet
Vance seems to argue correctly that the huge costs of continuing a massive but largely stalemated
war for even wealthy countries such as the Untied States and Europe is untenable in the long term
especially when Russia which is much more locally potent (in fighters equipment and resources)
has the advantage in a continuing war of attrition. Even now despite the horrendous Russian
casualties Ukraine seems to be straining much more than Russia to get desperately needed
fighters to the battlefield.
The United States and Europe have the leverage to convince the Ukrainians behind the scenes to
reach the realistic conclusion that they are not going to get all their territory back and that a
negotiated settlement to the conflict is needed. What may provide both warring countries a fig leaf
for any result that doesn?t meet nationalistic expectations would be holding referendums in the
occupied territories of Ukraine and now Russia to determine which government the largely Russian
speaking people there would like to live under. These would need to be internationally monitored
referendums not the sham ones the Russians earlier conducted there under military occupation and
intimidation.
Vance is correct that Ukraine should retain its independent and neutral sovereignty but not be
admitted to NATO. The foreign policy elites of the United States and Europe have had a hard time
processing that Russia invaded many times from the West feels threatened by a hostile alliance
expanded up to its borders. The United States likely would vigorously oppose Mexico or Canada
entering an anti-U.S. alliance with Russia or China.
The other concept that Joe Biden and the US foreign policy elite have never processed is thatalliances are not ends in themselves but a means to security. If war erupts again between Ukraine
and Russia?as it did in 2014 and 2022?and Ukraine is a member of NATO the United States would
be obligated under Article V of the treaty to directly come to Ukraine?s defense against a
nuclear-armed great power. Dragging the United States into an unneeded and potentially
cataclysmic war with Russia would hardly improve American security. And because the fate of
Ukraine and Russia are less strategic to the faraway United States than to nearby Europe Vance is
right that Germany (and other wealthy European nations) should foot the bill for reconstruction.",The American Conservative_J.D._Vance’s_Point_of_Departure_for_Peace_in_Ukrai.pdf.pdf,news_articles

revealed that the Special Counsel Jack Smith still intends to prosecute Trump for ?private crimes? in

so he acted with private co-conspirators whose names are redacted. The co-conspirators are

196,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Kamala Harris Wants to Turn the Page
In her recent appearance on The View Kamala Harris was asked if there is anything she would
have done differently than President Biden. Harris responded: ?There is not a thing that comes to
mind ? and I?ve been a part of ? the decisions that have had impact.? Harris?s fidelity to the Biden
agenda is not surprising. She has boasted in the past about being the last person in the room with
Biden when he made the disastrous decision to abandon Afghanistan give up the vital American air
base at Bagram and open the door to a rapid government takeover by the Taliban. Harris also is on
record as enthusiastically embracing Bidenomics with its recklessly high spending and record-high
inflation.
It is mildly perplexing that Harris would not change a thing from the Biden legacy given that five
short years ago she opposed fracking endorsed an open border wanted to eliminate the phrase
?illegal aliens? from the nomenclature advocated starting ?from scratch? to replace the Immigration
and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) and supported Medicare for all.
Advertisement
What seems more curious than her admission that she would not change any of Biden?s policies
despite their unpopular outcomes is Harris?s attempt to transform the election into a referendum on
the president who Biden defeated four years earlier. In the Harris camp (which includes a large
share of the media) the Trump administration not the Biden/Harris regime is the root cause of all of
today's problems. It?s as though Harris is starring in a sequel to the movie Back to the Future. Time
travel makes it possible to turn back the clock to the Trump era and erase the history of the recent
past. In the Harris screenplay the role of Biff the bully is assigned to Donald Trump who becomes
the scapegoat for all problems past and present.Harris?s running mate Tim Walz appeared to embrace the Back to the Future theme when he told a
Bethlehem Pennsylvania audience: ?We can't afford four more years of this!? Was this a Freudian
slip? In a literal sense Walz is correct. We really can't afford four more years of the disastrous
inflation sparked by Bidenomics which has become synonymous with overspending. More likely
Walz did not mean for us to take him so literally. Like Harris he really wants to lay the blame for the
problems of the recent past on the prior four years of the Trump administration. This is a feat that
defies both logic and common sense.
The notion that an incumbent administration can blame all of the nation?s problems on the
candidate four years removed from power is opportunistic but not realistic. Nonetheless the Back to
the Future theme appears to have gained some traction in that recent polls suggest a large share of
voters see Harris as the candidate of change. In an October New York Times/Siena poll Harris took
a lead of 46 percent to 44 percent among respondents who saw the vice president not Trump as
the candidate most likely to provide a departure from the status quo. Even Houdini may have found
it difficult to escape this paradox!
While Harris?s comments on The View suggest complete agreement with Biden?s policies and
programs her rhetoric on the campaign trail has been all about change. On Day One lots of stuff is
going to happen! She has exclaimed at nearly every campaign stop that ?We need to turn the
page!"" We definitely need to turn the page but just whose policies are we turning the page on? The
compliant media refuse to acknowledge that Harris can?t really turn the page on inflation or illegal
immigration or the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan much as she has tried to attach blame for
all of the Biden/Harris era woes to their predecessor. In an interview with Chuck Todd on Meet the
Press Harris said: ?We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation including ours
and our administration. But there are still a lot of problems we are trying to fix given the deterioration
that happened over the past four years before we came in.?Are we turning the page on the open border that Kamala Harris endorsed in 2019? ICE recently
released data indicating that the sheer volume of border crossings (which quadrupled under
Biden/Harris) has resulted in superficial screening and enforcement of immigration policy. ICE
indicates that a large number of illegal immigrants who have been charged with or convicted of
serious crimes in their home countries are now in the United States. In one such case that received
much attention Victor Martinez Hernandez of El Salvador was charged with the rape and murder of
Marylander Rachel Morin. Martinez Hernandez entered the United States illegally in February 2023
after murdering a young woman in El Salvador a month earlier.
We do need to turn the page but not for the reasons Harris presumes. We need to turn the page
for example on the Biden/Harris administration?s excessive spending including nearly $1 trillion in
the erroneously named ""Inflation Reduction Act? of 2022. Under this act billions were allocated to
provide subsidies for electric vehicles including federal tax credits of up to $7500 per car for
wealthy folks to purchase their new Teslas! Billions of additional dollars were allocated for climate
programs including $22 billion for ?Environmental Justice? broadly defined. The bill also included
$80 billion to hire more IRS agents to audit American taxpayers and small businesses and included
provisions to make sure restaurant workers pay taxes on their tips?clearly contradicting Harris?s
promise not to tax tips. And of course Harris would like us to turn the page on the fact that as vice
president she boasted about casting the tie-breaking vote for this legislative boondoggle which
helped fuel out-of-control inflation.
The Nixon mantra in 1972 was ""Four More Years!"" George H.W. Bush's theme in 1992 was ""Stay
the Course!' Those were honest forthright rallying calls. You either liked the record of the incumbent
president and his administration?s policies or you didn't. Harris has admitted that she would not
have changed any of Biden?s major policies so how did we reach the point where thesecond-in-command of a troubled administration can sound the theme ?We Need to Turn the
Page""?
We should not assume that Harris?s concept of ?turning the page? means closing the border or
reducing massive federal spending on green energy boondoggles or permitting fracking in
Pennsylvania. The Biden/Harris legacy has largely been written and it will be difficult to delete or edit
the fine print of what has occurred since January 20 2021. We cannot simply turn the page.",The American Conservative_Kamala_Harris_Wants_to_Turn_the_Page.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Vice President Kamala gave a major speech at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh Wednesday
afternoon laying out the approach to the American economy she intends to take if elected president
this November.
Harris repeatedly emphasized her own origin stating ?I grew up in a middle-class family? and
argued that her plan for what she called an ?opportunity economy? would be best for middle-class
Americans. Harris?s ?opportunity economy? plan consists of three primary pillars: lowering costs
investing in American innovation and entrepreneurship and leading the world in industries of the
future.
Advertisement
As part of the first pillar lowering costs Harris announced her support for an immediate tax cut for
middle class families an expanded Child Tax Credit of $6000 and the introduction of federally
mandated paid leave policies. In addition she also proposed a plan to reduce housing costs by
reducing federal regulations on housing construction providing $25000 of down-payment
assistance for first-time homebuyers and working ?with builders and developers to construct 3
million new homes and rentals for the middle class.? Finally she reiterated her support for a federal
ban on corporate price-gouging a controversial policy which drew wide-spread condemnation even
from friendly quarters when she first announced it in August.
Harris discussed two policies as part of the second pillar of her economic plan investing in
American innovation and entrepreneurship: first a massive increase in the available tax deduction
for business start-up costs from $5000 to $50000 and second providing low- and no-interest
loans to small businesses that want to expand.The third pillar of Harris?s ?opportunity economy? plan leading the world in industries of the future
included a pledge to invest heavily in leading-edge technological industries including
biomanufacturing AI quantum computing aerospace and blockchain. Additionally she pledged to
introduce tax credits for expanding union workforces and steel and iron manufacturing. She also
included a promise to increase apprenticeships and remove degree requirements for half a million
federal jobs streamline permitting and stand up to China against unfair trade practices.
Throughout the speech Harris made frequent references to former president Donald Trump arguing
that his priority is ensuring that the economy works for the rich rather than the middle class. She
also made a number of criticisms of his record as president arguing that his presidency resulted in
200000 outsourced manufacturing jobs reduced competitiveness with China and raised taxes on
middle-class Americans while cutting them for the wealthy.",The American Conservative_Kamala_Touts_‘Opportunity_Economy’_Plan_in_Pittsbu.pdf.pdf,news_articles

The former Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) joined Vice President Kamala Harris for a campaign
event in Ripon Wisconsin a small town known for its ?Little White Schoolhouse? where the
Republican Party was first organized.
The event was focused on attacking former president Donald Trump for his involvement in the
events of January 6 and emphasized his potential to endanger the Constitutional order and the
peaceful transfer of power.
Cheney who spoke first burnished her conservative credentials to mount an appeal to
Trump-skeptical Republicans. She noted that she cast her first vote for Ronald Reagan which she
said means that she ?was a Republican even before Donald Trump started spray tanning.?
Proclaiming herself a ?Ronald Reagan Republican? she subsequently urged those attending to
vote for Harris saying ?I know that a President Harris will be able to unite this nation I know that
she will be a president who will defend the rule of law and I know that she will be a president who
can inspire our children especially our little girls to do great things.?
Harris then took the stage and thanked Liz Cheney and her father former vice president Dick
Cheney for their endorsement and delivered her speech. She asserted that in contrast to herself
Donald Trump does not have the character necessary to uphold the presidential oath to uphold and
defend the constitution and pointed to his behavior during the 2020 presidential election and
January 6. She argued that Donald Trump will use presidential power to jail critics and journalists
and weaponize the Department of Justice for political purposes.

Amer Ghalib the mayor of Hamtramck Michigan the only Muslim-majority city in the United States
has endorsed the former President Donald Trump in this year?s presidential race. Ghalib was first
elected as mayor of Hamtramck in 2021 alongside an all-Muslim city council highlighting the
changing demographics of the once heavily Polish city.
?President Trump and I may not agree on everything but I know he is a man of principles? Ghalib
wrote in a Facebook post. ?Though it?s looking good he may or may not win the election and be
the 47th president of the United States but I believe he is the right choice for this critical time.?
Ghalib offered his support to Trump at a meeting with the former president last week in Flint. Ghalib
was born in Yemen but immigrated to the United States at the age of 17.
Ghalib and Hamtramck?s city council have exhibited a socially conservative streak in the past with
the council voting in 2023 to remove the LGBT pride flag from public property. ?You do not know our
city more than we do and you will not know the consequences of opening the door for every group
to fly their flag on city properties? Ghalib stated at the time.
The endorsement of Trump by Ghalib is notable. Michigan is unique among the swing-states for its
large Arab-American population. A recent poll conducted by the Council on American-Islamic
Relations found Muslim voters in Michigan to be split in their support of the major party candidates

As the presidential campaign enters its final full month before Election Day speculation is rife about
an October surprise. That?s the idea of a late-breaking news event especially in the form of a
well-timed oppo dump designed to hurt a particular candidate with the potential to upend the race.
The 2016 election featured two October surprises. There was the leak of the Access Hollywood
audio in which then-candidate Donald Trump made comments that were unquestionably lewd and
characterized by opponents as a taped confession of sexual assault. (Trump characterized his
words as ?locker room talk.?)
Advertisement
Many Republicans withdrew their endorsements and called on Trump to withdraw from the race.
GOP Chairman Reince Priebus who would go on to serve as Trump?s first White House chief of
staff advised him that the only alternative was to ?lose in the biggest landslide in history.?
Then came the second October surprise in the form of then-FBI Director James Comey?s letter
informing Congress of the discovery of new emails deemed pertinent to the investigation of Hillary
Clinton?s handling of classified documents. Not much came of it but Clinton blamed the letter and
WikiLeaks combined for her subsequent election loss.
It was like a political game of musical chairs ? whichever candidate is still working through a bad
news cycle when the music stops loses.
But it is possible that what will shape this year?s race for the White House in its closing weeks
won?t be a surprise at all. It will be the continuation of a trend happening in plain sight for much ofPresident Joe Biden?s term: growing chaos instead of the promised normalcy.
Iran has hammered Israel with ballistic missiles. Israel?s response has yet to be finalized as of this
writing but based on its recent strikes in the region is sure to be swift and possibly devastating.
Advertisement
Events closer to home are no more prosaic. A hurricane has devastated communities leaving
Americans ? many living in presidential battleground states ? underwater or out of their homes. A
major port workers strike could cripple supply chains.
When voters picked Biden over Trump many thought they were bringing down the curtain on the
Republican?s tumultuous first term and returning to more conventional presidential behavior. What
happened instead made many Americans long for Trump?s steady hand. It remains to be seen
whether enough voters feel that way to hand Trump a second term.
Trump?s detractors find all this unfathomable. Doesn?t the public remember the controversy du jour
the two impeachments the pandemic and January 6th? As perplexing as this may be to a lot of
people in Washington not all of them Democrats Trump is viewed more as the president of
pre-pandemic America than as the bungler of COVID-19. And even if you disliked the lockdowns
school closures and George Floyd riots is Trump really more likely to bring back the worst of 2020
than the Democrats?
Vice President Kamala Harris has replaced Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. She clearly
wants to forget as much of 2020 (and 2019) as humanly possible. It?s worked reasonably well in the
polls up to this point though it hasn?t been the total game-changer it appeared to be as recently asthe Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
In recent days Biden intermittently staying in the White House while Harris practices a form of highly
selective incumbency has had the feel of an eerie limbo. It will be hard to avoid accountability for the
dramatic events unfolding in the news. And while Trump hasn?t become a steadier personality since
leaving office the fact that the end of his time in the Oval Office did not conclude the unceasing
drama of American daily life may yet again redound to his benefit.
The question is whether Trump more than Biden and Harris can better manage the tensions now
inflaming the globe ? or better yet appreciate the limits of Washington?s ability to manage them.
Trump would like to be a dealmaker who negotiates an end to the wars that risk ensnaring the
United States and its allies. But he is also personally dealing with Iranian provocation and remains
an unpredictable force.

201,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Obama and Clinton Haunt Harris
Vice President Kamala Harris has brought out the big guns in the closing weeks of the presidential
campaign but they are mostly misfiring.
The big headlines from the Democrats? past White House winners hitting the campaign trail this
week were not the ones Harris would want. The former President Barack Obama lectured black men
who aren?t yet on board with the current Democratic ticket bringing all his bitter clinger charm in
implying they are sexist despite polling showing they were also out (and in somewhat larger
numbers) on President Joe Biden.
Advertisement
Then former President Bill Clinton suggested that with better vetting Laken Riley might not have
been murdered by an illegal immigrant. This does not seem like a glowing endorsement of the
Biden-Harris border policy but Clinton said because of low birthrates we need more immigration
anyway.
All this comes amid new reporting of tensions between the Biden and Harris teams in the waning
days of the presidential race. Democrats are freshly relitigating Biden?s ouster as Election Day fast
approaches apparently impervious to the fact he remains the sitting president.
Every one of these men in their prime had more natural political talent than Harris currently
possesses though it?s open to debate how close any of them are to still operating at their peak
level. But they all also have made it more difficult for Harris to follow in their footsteps.
The most obvious is Biden whose conspicuous failures in office alongside his advanced agenecessitated Harris?s ascension to the top of the ticket in the first place. Harris is culpable in nearly
all of these to be sure including the concealment of Biden?s dotage. But if the incumbent had
delivered on the promises of his 2020 campaign ? moderate institutionalist who will make deals and
restore normalcy ? she would be in something closer to George H.W. Bush?s position in 1988 than
Hubert Humphrey?s 20 years before that.
Yet if Obama hadn?t decimated the Democratic bench reducing it to a left flank of deep blue-state
lawmakers in a pair of midterm ?shellackings? the party would not have needed to turn to someone
as old as Biden to find a mainstream Democrat with a plausible presidential resume. And Biden?s
vice presidential shortlist might have had more names on it besides Harris?s.
Advertisement
Obama to some extent understands the former President Donald Trump?s appeal better than most
Democrats of his era. But Obama still doesn?t draw any conclusions about how he could have
possibly drawn Trump as his successor beyond the self-serving ones. If Obama?s economy was so
great good enough to extend into Trump?s term why did it produce so much discontent ? even
among people who had voted Democratic at the presidential level in 2008 and 2012?
It?s also likely the case that Obama goaded Trump into making good on his threats to enter national
politics in the first place to the applause of many who spent the next decade worrying about
democracy dying in darkness. But the possibility that so imperfect a vessel as Trump might
transform the GOP into a multiracial working-class party is more damning.
The same criticism can be made of Clinton. If he had dealt with immigration while in office following
his own commission?s recommendations and thought differently about post-Cold War and pre-9/11foreign-policy challenges there might have been less of a constituency or opportunity for Trump.
Regime change in Iraq and NAFTA became national policy under Clinton who also flip-flopped on
China?s trade status.
Clinton ought to at least ponder why he was able to carry West Virginia twice while the state is now
reliably Republican at the presidential level for the foreseeable future.
Yes it is easier to blame Rush Limbaugh or Fox News than the Democrats? own complicity in the
failures of the bipartisan establishment. But a little self-awareness never hurt anyone. Clinton?s
whole political career was premised on learning some of the right lessons about why Democrats
kept losing elections to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
Harris is nevertheless in a highly competitive race. If she doesn?t make it to the Oval Office her own
strategic decisions will play a big role in that failure. But the ghosts of Democratic presidencies past
haven?t made her task any easier. If she wins it will be at least as much in spite of them as due to
their assistance.",The American Conservative_Obama_and_Clinton_Haunt_Harris.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Donald Trump is the favored candidate for president among registered Arab American voters with
42 percent to Vice President Kamala Harris?s 41 percent. Among those polled who say they are

percent favor Republicans for control of the next Congress compared to 43 percent who prefer a

The new poll offers a sharp contrast to 2020 when the same organization reported that 59 percent
of Arab Americans planned to vote for the Democrat Joe Biden and only 35 percent intended to vote

Sheinbaum is using today?s inauguration to bolster her left-wing credentials refusing to invite
Spanish King Felipe VI to her own coronation in Mexico City. She cited Felipe?s refusal to apologize
to Mexico for alleged colonial crimes perpetrated against the Aztecs and other indigenous tribes a
half-millennium ago. The row started with Sheinbaum?s mentor President Andres Manuel López

to apologize perhaps recognizing that what we now consider human rights were undeniably
enhanced after the barbaric Aztec empire was defeated. He also likely perceived that AMLO?s
actions were inspired by his affection for half-baked 1970s social activism and his propensity to stir
controversy for political gain. Untethered by the sometimes gross demands of popular democracy
Felipe simply ignored AMLO.
Tensions between Mexico and her mother country seemed to cool in the subsequent years but
Sheinbaum?s recent actions have rekindled the dispute as an opening salvo of her presidency.
Spain?s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez who received an invitation separate from his monarch was
quick to point out the obvious political motivations of the act and was generally indignant in hisresponse. Speaking from the United Nations Sánchez retaliated by withholding diplomatic
representation at the inauguration.
?Spain and Mexico are brotherly peoples. We cannot therefore accept being excluded like this?
he said. ?That is why we have made it known to the Mexican government that there will be no
diplomatic representative from the Spanish government as a sign of protest.?
As the former general secretary of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party Sánchez?s decision to
issue a diplomatic rebuke is rather notable. Sánchez has spent years in Spain drumming up
historical grievances of his own particularly surrounding the Franco regime of the last century.
Sheinbaum?s decision to alienate a potential partner in this context illustrates the depths of her
radicalism and commitment to late-century anti-colonial ideology.
The development has disappointed Mexican observers who believed Sheinbaum?s election
presented an opportunity to cool a body politic increasingly gripped by polarization. Noting the
Vatican?s recent calls for reconciliation the Mexico News Daily editorial board claimed in August
that ?there is considerable expectation that Sheinbaum will be less confrontational than López
Obrador who often uses his morning press conference to attack political opponents a tactic that
many say foments or at least contributes to divisiveness in Mexico.? It?s clear from Sheinbaum?s
time as president-elect that this wishful thinking will not materialize. Like AMLO Sheinbaum is a
figure who embraces near-meaningless grievance as a means of whipping up popular support.
Sheinbaum?s signaling has implications for U.S.?Mexico relations. Millions of Mexican nationals
living in the United States are eligible to vote in Mexico?s federal elections and many did by mail
and at consulates across the United States. The radicalization of Mexico?s politics now devolving
into something akin to American wokeness impacts the perceptions and feelings of a large swatheof people living on the American side of the border. This presents a unique challenge to American
sovereignty threatening to further undermine U.S. border enforcement trade negotiations and
impose foreign polarization on American policymakers.
To date Mexican leadership has generally refrained from racializing security negotiations with
American leaders. Under pressure from President Donald Trump AMLO was even willing to commit
to providing border security supplying the bulk of resources necessary to enact the ?Remain in
Mexico? policy that helped reduce illegal border crossings to record lows in 2020. AMLO?s
cooperation with Trump demonstrated that despite his rhetoric he was at core a pragmatist. The
United States may find that Sheinbaum at her core is not.
If Trump is reelected in a month and moves forward with his plans to carry out the largest
deportation in American history Sheinbaum?s radicalism and embrace of racialized politics could
become a major diplomatic flashpoint. It?s easy to imagine how a Mexican president armed with
cynicism and a socialist base would benefit from accusing American leadership of colonialism
racism or any of the other buzzwords regularly employed to justify the destruction of Western
democracy. The implications for the American body politic now including nearly 40 million people of
Mexican descent are unclear but self-evidently negative. The necessary deportation program
proposed by the Trump-Vance ticket seeking to deport 13000 murderers among others will already
be controversial enough in an intractably polarized country. If Sheinbaum chooses to dump fuel on
the fire the consequences related to assimilation and practical security could be long-lasting and
irreparable.",The American Conservative_Sheinbaum’s_Inaugural_Radicalism.pdf.pdf,news_articles

This election is rigged. That was the word that Jimmy Carter got by phone. A message that became
his obsession. One that changed his life.
It was Election Day 1962. Carter was a 38-year-old Georgia peanut farmer and chairman of the
Sumter County School Board. He was running in a Democratic primary for a new seat in the Georgia
State Senate hopeful that voters in Southwest Georgia would select him to represent them in
Atlanta.

The supporter who telephoned Carter had few details other than that something troubling was
underway with the votes in Quitman County. So Carter rushed to the courthouse to investigate.
The first thing he noticed was that there weren?t any voting booths. Instead tables were out in the
open. Ballots were stacked on them. Next to them were some campaign cards. When Carter got
closer he saw that they were promoting his opponent Homer Moore. There was Homer?s smiling
visage splashed on the cover.
Carter watched as voters requested ballots. A man would scrunch up next to them as he handed
them over. He would point to Homer?s picture ?This is a good man and my friend.?
That was the Quitman County?s political boss Joe Hurst. And he was overseeing this election.
Hurst controlled everything in that county. For example his wife ran the county?s welfare system so
Joe made the state welfare department send recipients? checks to them direct. That way he could
distribute the money himself. Joe Hurst didn?t want any ambiguity about who had sway.He was planning to build a new subdivision on nearby Lake Eufaula (which was renamed the Walter
F. George Lake in 1963) and knew that Homer Moore would help. Jimmy Carter?well he was
running on a clean government platform. Jimmy might not be supportive of how they did things down
in Quitman County Hurst concluded.

?Where are the voting booths?? Carter asked.
?This is just a simple election for one office that we?ve decided they?re not necessary today? Hurst
said.
?The law requires that people vote in secret and you?re watching everyone? Carter said.
?People don?t mind if we know what they do? Hurst said.
Exasperated Carter left the courthouse.
Later that night as the returns started flowing in Carter was ahead by 70 votes. Quitman County
remained to be counted but if the trend continued Carter would prevail. Soon Quitman County
officials reported their totals. Jimmy lost.
When Carter tried to tell a reporter the story of what he?d witnessed on Election Day the reporter
said it wasn?t newsworthy. ?He was not interested in writing any story critical of election procedure
in Quitman County? Carter recalled. Later Jimmy discovered that the reporter and Joe Hurst werebuddies.
The results from that election night haunted Jimmy. He grew depressed and lost weight. He had to
do something to address this gross injustice. As Carter aide Peter Bourne told me ?Jimmy couldn?t
live with himself.? He decided to contest the election but was fearful of being branded a sore loser.
As former President Jimmy Carter turns 100 this week media coverage is portraying him as a
righteous chief executive. His biographer Kai Bird author of The Outlier asserts that Carter led a
scandal-free presidency and read 200 pages of memoranda daily. On October 1 President Joe
Biden declared that Carter is ?a moral force for a nation and the world.? And in a recent New York
Times piece ex-Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter says Carter is ?the ultimate un-Trump.? (For
perspective Alter also says that Donald Trump is ?the most dangerous threat to democracy in
American history.?)
Typical of how Jimmy is being celebrated was captured by someone I follow on Instagram. He
posted images of Carter as photographed by Andy Warhol and wrote ?Quiet-spoken and humble
two qualities that didn?t play against the rough-and-tumble of politics? Jimmy Carter was the
exemplar of the American value of service to others: putting your own interests second helping the
less fortunate providing welcome to the stranger fighting for justice for those who have learned not
to expect it.?
All are missing Carter?s essence?the indispensable element that it took for Jimmy to get from the
Governor?s Mansion in Georgia to ?higher office? which was the euphemism that Carter aide
Hamilton Jordan and others would use when they approached Jimmy and whispered about their
unique plan to get him in the White House.It is the quality that Hunter Thompson identified when he put Jimmy Carter in league with
Muhammad Ali and Hells Angels leader Sonny Barger. ?A sheer functional meanness meaning the
ability to get from A to B to C M Z?whatever you want? Thompson said. ?He would cut both your
legs off to carry a ward in the Bronx and never apologize for it. He understands the system.?
Jimmy had two secret weapons?Hamilton Jordan and another Georgian Jody Powell. Both came to
him saying they wanted to be a part of his campaign asking How can we help?
In strokes of brilliance Carter helped Jordan get a job at the Democratic National Committee up in
Washington. This was to develop a network to help Carter line up political staffers become
well-versed with how the party worked understand how the nomination unfolded. ?It allowed Jordan
to keep Carter constantly informed about what was going on at the DNC? Bourne said.
Carter?s next genius move was to travel the country with Powell and campaign for Democratic
congressional candidates leading up to the 1974 elections. ?In many instances Carter went to some
obscure districts? Bourne recalled. ?A lot of these people won because of Carter and they were all
very indebted. So when Jimmy was running for president he could immediately call them and say
?Can your people who helped you get elected help me in my campaign for president?? Nobody had
thought of this strategically in this way before.?
Carter?s trajectory was stunning especially for Southerners. Even as a little boy growing up in North
Carolina at the time I seemed to understand how remarkable he was. As the Texan author Larry K.
Ling wrote in Esquire in 1976 ?If you wanted to become much more than justice of the peace in
Deep Gritsville then you puckered up your lips and bought a bus ticket north and some mouthwash
for afterward. So they sat back and waited for Carter to come around with his hand out begging
Gimme gimme/My name?s Jimmy. They?re still waiting cousin.? Years later as an adult after beingaround Washington for a while I realized that Larry was telling the truth.
When Carter accepted his party?s nomination at the Democratic Convention in New York City he
declared that ?too many have had to suffer at the hands of a political and economic elite who have
shaped decisions and never had to account for mistakes nor to suffer from injustice.? In response
news coverage blasted Carter as a populist demagogue.
The political reporters who were on the trail with Carter downplayed this insurgency and instead
focused on the horserace. During one session of the infamous interview that Carter gave to
Playboy which was conducted on the campaign plane Jimmy said ?The national news media have
no interest in issues at all. What they?re looking for is a 47-second argument between me and
another candidate or something like that. There?s nobody in the back of this plane who would ask
an issue question unless he thought he could trick me into some crazy statement.? But voters still
heard the signal and elected Jimmy in what his mother Miss Lillian called ?the greatest miracle that
ever happened.?
When writers such as Bird Alter and others chart the demise of Carter?s presidency they focus on
the ?misery index? of the late-1970s Islamic radicals who took Americans hostage in Iran the
Soviets invading Afghanistan?all were important factors. But they miss the seeds of Jimmy?s
ultimate defeat which were planted during the transition to the presidency in late 1976 when the
president-elect staffed his administration.
As Jimmy?s longtime aide Greg Schneiders admitted to me a few years ago ?Hamilton Jordan said
that if people like Cy Vance and Zbig Brzezinski are in our administration I?m going to quit. That
captured it pretty well which was This was all about insurgency. This was about taking on the
establishment. And if we end up with an establishment cabinet and administration then we will havelost. And to a large degree that?s what happened.?
Bourne told me that when he was first getting acquainted with Carter in the early 1970s he was
convinced that somewhere in Jimmy?s background there were a bunch of gray-haired old men
whom he consulted with all the time. ?I discovered that the only person in that category was a man
called Charles Kirbo but there were no others. Everybody else were people who?d been loyal to him
back to his first gubernatorial campaign in 1966. They were not politically experienced people. The
competent experienced people were not loyal to him.?
The ?malaise? of 1980 wore Jimmy down like it did the rest of us. He seemed to try everything to
reverse the feeling of dread including when he stopped parting his hair on the right and started
parting it on the left. Nothing seemed to work. The famous grin transformed into what we call in the
South a ?shit-eating grin.? As Roy Blount once wrote of Jimmy?s signature expression ?I guess
you know what that is. If you have ever seen a dog eating some. A dog is a noble animal in many
ways but it will eat shit sometimes when it finds some appealing?. It has this sort of mean shame to
it. It has the courage and pure pleasure of mean shame. White folks in the South have had to eat a
lot of shit.?
That indignity of 1980?it no doubt reminded Jimmy of the year he decided to contest the election in
Georgia. Even after his presidency he said that he couldn?t remember any other time when he felt
more out of place or when his efforts seemed more fruitless than 1962.
In the end Jimmy?s election contest was right. The system and the votes were rigged against him.
But Georgia?s election law was abysmal and anyone who objected couldn?t demand more than a
basic recount of ballots.There were 433 ballots in that old box in Quitman County. And as Jimmy put it ?according to the
names listed 126 of these voted alphabetically! When the ballots were unfolded there were
sometimes four to eight of them folded together.?
Carter and a lawyer sought out witnesses; they collected affidavits swearing to the corruption.
Jimmy said people threatened to kill him if he continued and that party thugs tried intimidating his
sources.
The contest consumed him. ?I almost memorized the Georgia election code and it seemed obvious
that almost every section of it had been violated? he wrote in Why Not the Best? published in
1976.
In the end Carter found a lawyer who would help: Charles Kirbo of Atlanta who was then a spry 45.
He got a judge to listen to them and review their evidence including that there were more ballots
counted than issued. The judge ruled that the primary election was fraudulent. And he declared
Jimmy Carter the winner.
But the Democratic Party machine appealed the judge?s decision and the local Democratic
executive committee made Moore the winner instead.
Kirbo tracked the state Democratic Party chairman J.B. Fuqua all the way to Canada where he was
on a hunting trip. A soft-drink manufacturer who also owned a TV station in Augusta Georgia
Fuqua listened as Kirbo chronicled what Jimmy and he uncovered. Kirbo showed him the
documents. After being persuaded that Jimmy?s case was solid Fuqua had the state party?s
executive committee name Carter to be the nominee. That fall Jimmy was elected to the Georgia
senate.?The local political leader was subsequently convicted in federal court for wire fraud in an earlier
election for Congress and given a three-year suspended sentence? Carter wrote. ?Later he served
time for running an illegal liquor distribution operation in Quitman County.?
So just what did Jimmy Carter learn? ?I began to realize how vulnerable our political system was to
an accumulation of unchallenged power? he wrote in 1976. ?Honest and courageous people could
be quieted when they come to realize that outspoken opposition was fruitless. The dishonest could
band together to produce and divide the spoils and they could easily elect officials who most often
seemed respectable but who would cooperate in order to gain a title or office.?
Some 23 years after Carter?s presidency ended he studied election fraud with the likes of James A.
Baker III Lee Hamilton and Tom Daschle. Their Commission on Federal Election Reform identified
absentee ballots as at the greatest risk of election fraud. Mail-in voting Carter and his team
concluded is the largest source of potential vote fraud.
When I interviewed Jimmy in 2015 he recognized the rise of Donald Trump and told me that there
was an awakening underway in the U.S. ?I don?t know how trenchant or permanent it will be? he
said. After Trump was elected president Carter offered to go to North Korea on behalf of Trump to
meet with Kim Jong Un to try to bring about peace. At first Trump seemed interested but then he
passed on Carter?s offer. Later that summer Jimmy lashed out ?There is no doubt that the
Russians did interfere in the [2016] election. I think the interference though not yet quantified if fully
investigated would show that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. Trump lost the election
and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.?
After the election of 2020 Trump filed just one election contest in the U.S. It was in the state ofGeorgia. But he couldn?t get a judge to read it and the contest was dismissed.
Reflecting on Jimmy?s centenary I?m reminded of what the Democratic Representative Mo Udall of
Arizona said back in 1976 after Carter defeated him for the Democratic nomination for president. ?If
Carter?s elected he?ll never make Mount Rushmore because there?s not room enough for two
more faces.?",The American Conservative_Stopping_the_Steal—in_1962.pdf.pdf,news_articles

?You can kiss your sales from your Republican audience goodbye Taylor. I hope you enjoyed them
while you had them? wrote the podcaster Megyn Kelly after the billionaire singer-songwriter Taylor
Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president.
In Kelly?s estimation Swift did so at the most opportunistic moment and in the most annoying way
possible and ought to pay a price for it. She held off until just after former President Donald
Trump?s less-than-stellar performance in his televised September 10 debate with Vice President
Kamala Harris and then posted a picture on Instagram with a cat posed on her shoulder along with
a note.
Advertisement
After laying out her reasons for endorsing the Democratic ticket of Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (MN)
the singer signed off with the words ?Taylor Swift Childless Cat Lady.? This was a dig at the
Republican vice presidential hopeful Sen. J.D. Vance (OH) who wants the tax code changed to
further incentivize childrearing and has characterized some of his opponents using the term Swift
embraced. It was also a shot at Trump himself who amplified rumors of Haitian refugees in the U.S.
eating cats and dogs in his debate with Harris.
Her post-debate endorsement kicked off two new debates. One debate was about Swift?s influence
on the election. The other arguably more interesting debate was about the repercussions for
Swift?s brand from her political activism.
Swift?s endorsement like a great many of her words and actions made headlines. ?Swift
outswaggers Trump with her Kamala Harris vote? the front page of the Los Angeles Times blared.In her Instagram note she explained her own choice and encouraged her supporters to cast their
own informed votes.
On the choice to endorse at all Swift argued that she was pushed into it by Trump and his
campaign.
?Recently I was made aware that AI of ?me? falsely endorsing Donald Trump?s presidential run
was posted to his site? she wrote. ?It really conjured up my fears around AI and the dangers of
spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about
my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the
truth.?
Advertisement
Swift endorsed Harris as a ?steady-handed gifted leader? who embodies ?calm and not chaos.?
She also praised Gov. Walz who she said ?has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights IVF and a
woman?s right to her own body for decades.?
She told supporters that they ought to do their own ?research? to cast an informed choice and gave
them a reminder: ?Remember that in order to vote you have to be registered! I also find it?s much
easier to vote early.?
The hope of Harris supporters is that many of Swift?s fans known as ?Swifties? will register and
vote early giving the ticket a boost in what is shaping up to be a close election in the electoral
college. Conversely the hope of Trump supporters is that the endorsement will turn out to be
ineffectual or better yet backfire.Early evidence is mixed. ?Taylor Swift?s impact on voter engagement is undeniable? Andrea
Hailey chief executive of Vote.org told the New York Times. ?The important thing to remember is
that Taylor?s work serves as a model that everyone with a platform can use to encourage
Americans to participate in civic engagement.?
Ryan James Girdusky author of the National Populist Newsletter and a contributing editor of The
American Conservative poured cold water all over similar assessments.
?Following Taylor Swift?s endorsement of Kamala Harris there was no noticeably significant voter
registration surge in crucial swing states compared to 2020? he wrote. ?Republicans out-registered
Democrats in North Carolina Florida and Pennsylvania in the week that followed her
endorsement.?
The effects on Swift?s reputation are easier to quantify at least in the short term. Morning Consult
ran surveys and found that her negatives among Republicans have climbed to 57 percent today up
from 35 percent in February. It?s still true that 49 percent of voters overall have favorable vibes
toward Swift but the bottom line according to the consultancy is that she has become ?more
polarizing.?
That?s not necessarily bad news in politics. Polarization can be an effective way to win elections.
But businesses typically aim for the widest support possible and Swift?s business had been
booming.
Swift?s Eras Tour concert ticket sales are forecast to reach $2.2 billion and the tour film did over
$100 million in advanced ticket sales. On the U.S. leg Swift brought in ?an estimated $13 million inticket sales per night attracting an average of 72000 spectators per concert? Statista reported.
Swift also amassed her dragon?s horde in a novel way. ?In October 2023 Taylor Swift
accomplished a feat no other musician had before: she became a billionaire primarily off of earnings
from her music and performances? Forbes reported.
The fact that Swift did this without any ?side hustles? may be impressive. Nevertheless in theory it
should render her business more vulnerable to reputational damage that comes along with political
bad blood.
The Los Angeles Times published a spate of letters in response to its cover story about her
endorsement that were surprisingly hostile. One writer brought up the famous quote by basketball
superstar Michael Jordan. ?Republicans buy sneakers too? Jordan quipped. That didn?t stop him
from making political donations to progressive politicians during the height of his career but it did
make him less of an outspoken activist.
On top of that many critics have pointed to a ?get woke go broke? dynamic in popular
entertainment that could apply here. Sometimes cultural political shifts by content makers can
alienate part of their original audience. Swift had released songs that contained such themes
particularly 2019?s culture-war courting song and music video ?You Need to Calm Down.?
More recently she zagged. In her hit song ?Anti-Hero? Swift even took a shot at her own past self
as ?the problem.? ?Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism / Like some kind of
congressman?? the narrator asks. ?I wake up screaming from dreaming / One day I?ll watch as
you?re leaving.?Yet so far evidence that Swift?s Harris-Walz endorsement is driving away a mass of fans is only
anecdotal. Some fans who are also Trump supporters have complained publicly and sold off their
concert tickets. These have found ready buyers.
Her music continues to be in heavy rotation on the radio and streaming. Her song ?I Can Do It With
a Broken Heart? was at number 34 on Billboard?s Hot 100 at press time for instance down from
number 26 the week before.

but did not deign to reply.",The American Conservative_Taylor_Swift’s_‘Errors’_Tour.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Claudia Sheinbaum was sworn in as Mexico?s president last Tuesday. Her ceremony was replete
with the pomp and circumstance expected of the Gobierno de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos. Her
Toma de Protesta (oath of office speech) was delivered with a mild-mannered cool affect?starkly
contrasting with the flair and bombast of her predecessor Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO).
On matters of substance however the event cemented AMLO?s legacy in Mexican history.
Sheinbaum paid AMLO reverent homage hailing his personal and political achievements:
You [AMLO] have asked us on several occasions not to unveil busts or put your name on streets
avenues or neighborhoods; nor monuments or making great tributes. The truth is that you don't
need to because you will always be where only those who fight all their lives reside those who do
not give up those who restore hope and joy; you will always be in the heart of the people of Mexico.

Sheinbaum's speech itself was AMLO?s first great tribute. The Señora Presidenta postulated that
?Mexican Humanism? which she dubbed a ""peaceful revolution"" and the ""Fourth Transformation of
Mexico's public life"" will be carried on in earnest. She waxed on noting AMLO?s activism as a
means of firing another diplomatic shot at Spain:
He retires from public life as a democrat and Maderista to continue fighting from another trench to
write about what he has maintained since his first days when he worked with the Chontal Maya: that
the origin of Mexico's cultural greatness lies in the great civilizations that lived in this land centuries
before the Spaniards invaded. It is no coincidence but a harmony of history that yesterday the
reform of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States was published in the Official
Gazette of the Federation granting full rights to the indigenous and Afro-Mexican peoples ofMexico.
Sheinbaum?s potent oratory laid out a sweeping visionary account of Mexican history. From the
revolutionaries to the activists of 1968 to Pancho Villa Sheinbaum deified a litany of progressive
national heroes and symbols. Omitted naturally were the symbols and legacies of men who
represented what Sheinbaum might call a less-progressed Mexico. King Felipe VI wasn?t invited
after all.
Mexico?s first female president continued the aspirational address with similar deifications of
Mexican women. Capitalizing on her mandate she made an unequivocally feminist speech though
not in the grievance-laden manner associated with American feminism. Her remarks contained only
one passing condemnation of machismo. The message largely focused on addressing the material
needs of Mexican women a noble endeavor in a nation that still faces a 43 percent poverty rate.
Sheinbaum laid the cornerstone of AMLO?s monument throughout the policy-oriented section of her
speech. Mirroring AMLO?s 2018 Toma De Protesta she listed her commitments and priorities one
to one hundred. The beginning of Sheinbaum?s list recounted specific commitments to Mexican
Humanism and emphasized broad populist economic policies. Given her party?s economic
successes Sheinbaum was able to indict the pre-AMLO past with authority:
Advertisement
The answer is: It [AMLO?s sixenio] changed the country?s development model from the failed
neoliberal model and the regime of corruption and privileges to one that emerged from Mexico's
fertile history love for the people and honesty. We call it Mexican Humanism.AMLO did indeed change Mexico?s developmental model. Embracing LNG and other fossil fuels
AMLO enabled a post-COVID manufacturing boom. Having successfully negotiated the USMCA
Agreement AMLO masterfully positioned Mexico for the onset of nearshoring. Impressive
infrastructure projects across the country are being completed at a rapid clip including transnational
railways and port construction. The country benefited from record foreign investment throughout
2024 and has amassed an impressive roster of relocations. Morena has capitalized on the windfall
funding generous social programs that have contributed to the party?s staggering popularity.
Though Mexico continues to struggle with inflation the AMLO years fostered a relatively stable
peso especially in the eyes of an electorate accustomed to volatility.
Anecdotally a conventional bullishness percolates in Texas. I?ve heard Dallas energy retailers
Houston pipeline salesmen and Austin tech engineers all say the same thing: ?Watch out for
Mexico.? I can?t say I share the optimism but the integration of the Texas triangle into a wider Latin
American market especially in light of the creation of the TXSE in DFW is viewed as inevitable.
I hate to break the news to my bullish Texas friends reading this but Claudia Sheinbaum spent
three years at the California Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory completing a PhD thesis in
energy engineering. Her speech reflected an appreciation for market-oriented renewable
investment but contained a pledge to cap fossil fuel consumption at a daily 1.8 million barrels. She
provided an assessment befitting a Berkeley education:
We are going to promote energy efficiency and the transition to renewable sources of energy to
absorb through these sources the growth in energy demand. Remember that the energy reform
proposed a production of three million barrels per day. That is environmentally impossible; it is better
to promote efficiency and renewable sources.I wrote last week that the United States might find Sheinbaum to be a less practical actor than her
predecessor. Nearshoring a critical priority for the United States as the global order frays requires
Mexican investment in fossil fuel production. The energy output required for manufacturing growth
cannot be achieved by cobbling together an assortment of renewables. Taking Sheinbaum?s words
this task would be ?environmentally impossible.? Her environmental proposals coupled with judicial
reform and broadly left-wing rhetoric fueled a 14 percent drop in the peso?s value in the aftermath
of her election. The delivery of her speech might communicate moderation to Americans
accustomed to vitriolic rhetoric but doubling down on ill-conceived ideological commitments amid a
currency downturn is generally considered political malpractice. Ask Liz Truss.
Sheinbaum?s inflexible environmental views won?t just endanger further economic integration it will
endanger the sustainability of social subsidies that have proved the foundation of Morena?s
popularity. Sheinbaum armed with her PhD will stake her presidency and popularity on reversing a
key component of the AMLO developmental model she so ardently hails. Limiting fossil fuel
extraction is a risky bet across multiple fronts.
Despite this Sheinbaum?s speech was impressive. It was visionary in its ambition sweeping in
scope and straightforward in purpose and policy. From an American conservative?s perspective
her remarks might smack of socialism or climate alarmism but those are mundane grievances. The
troubling aspect of Sheinbaum?s address rather was what was communicated by omission.
Sheinbaum made no reference to the ongoing crisis at the U.S .?Mexico border or human trafficking.
This is remarkable given that American politics are wholly subsumed to the crisis. Sheinbaum would
speak briefly on the need to reduce record homicides but only as a segue to attack Felipe
Calderón?s mid-2000s war on drugs: ?In terms of security we will guarantee the reduction of
high-impact crimes. Calderón?s irresponsible war on drugs which continues to do so much damageto Mexico will not return. Our conviction is that security and peace are the fruit of justice.?
In other words Sheinbaum plans to continue AMLO?s failed ""hugs not bullets"" approach to
narco-terrorism. Morena?s record on crime has been catastrophic for Mexico?s citizenry. Homicides
have been roughly 30?40 percent higher during the AMLO years than they were during the
much-demonized war on drugs. Large swaths of the country remain under paramilitary control while
human and drug trafficking markets are booming. Unless serious reversals are achieved Mexico will
lose their 500000th citizen to drug-related homicide sometime during Sheinbaum?s term. Soon the
death toll will surpass that of Mexico?s cataclysmic War of Independence from Spain. Are Mexican
citizens sure Felipe VI is the head of state who owes them an apology?
Sheinbaum?s only substantive mention of migration was her reference to the ?heroes and
heroines? living in the United States sending ?help? back to communities in Mexico. The overt
praise for the $60 billion remittance flow from the United States to Mexico was jaw-dropping. Capital
outflow associated with remittances reduces domestic demand and contributes to American wage
stagnation. This practice accomplished mostly via criminally trafficked labor is inherently at odds
with the economic interests of U.S. citizens. Sheinbaum?s open and profuse praise for the practice
(with FLOTUS in attendance) lends credence to the unsettling suspicion that the Mexican
government is acting (or rather not acting) to let traffickers operate undeterred. The financial motive
is there after all. When remittances of the U.S. dollar account for four percent of your nation?s GDP
confronting traffickers could become costly. One could also speculate that the Biden administration
has been using this flow of remittances as a form of back-door foreign aid.
Claudia Sheinbaum may not be the most important head of state in the minds of the next American
administration?s diplomats. Heads of state in Eastern Europe and the Middle East are competing for
the guest-of-honor invitation to the State Department happy hour. But for an American presidentconcerned with solving key crises of national interest?supply-chain security migration fentanyl
proliferation?engagement with Mexico will be crucial. Sheinbaum?s address shows that like her
predecessor Mexico is prepared to assert a sharp interpretation of their national interests. It would
be a mistake to underestimate her political appeal and by extension Mexico?s new concept of
self-identity. For the next sexenio Claudia Sheinbaum will be a crucial figure in the story of the
United States. She follows a man whose approval ratings and public adoration defy a dreary global
political climate. AMLO has fundamentally reoriented Mexican politics with consequences likely to
resonate for decades. Will a great woman follow the great man?",The American Conservative_The_Dangerous_Radical_on_Our_Southern_Border.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Barely 30 days before the 2024 election the Justice Department sued the state of Virginia to
prohibit its removal of the names of noncitizens from voting rolls. Gov. Glenn Youngkin was
enforcing a 2006 Virginia law but the Biden administration portrayed that action as an attack on
?the cornerstone of our democracy.? Youngkin denounced the federal lawsuit as ?a desperate
attempt to attack the legitimacy of the elections? in Virginia.

The Virginia lawsuit is simply the latest in Democrats? long war against honest voting which began
with the Clinton administration?s Motor Voter Act. That 1993 law mandated voter registration in
every welfare and food-stamp office in the nation. Brent Thompson executive director of the Fair
Government Foundation observed in 1996 ?The Motor Voter law did away with a panoply of
anti-fraud mechanisms long relied on by the states to police and deter fraudulent voting.?
In 2015 the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton condemned voter identification
requirements as part of a ?sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color poor
people and young people.? A Washington Post headline aptly summarized her message: ?Hillary
Clinton Declares War on Voter ID.? Verifying identification was unnecessary because as long as
enough ballots showed up with a check by Hillary?s name she would be irrevocably entitled to all
the power she could seize in the following four years.
Lax voting procedures in some states were insufficient to enable Hillary to capture the White House.But the panic induced by Covid-19 enabled politicians to radically loosen the rules for the next
presidential election. Many states made it easier?if not automatic?to vote by mail even though a
2012 New York Times analysis concluded that ?fraud in voting by mail is? vastly more prevalent
than the in-person voting fraud that has attracted far more attention.? Some states abandoned any
effort to verify mail ballots dropping requirements for matching signatures return addresses or
having a witness verify the person and the vote. Civil Rights Commissioner J. Christian Adams
noted that ?Democrats succeeded in tossing out state laws related to absentee ballot verification
deadlines and a whole range of laws all in the name of Covid.?
Neither the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution (rules for federal elections ?shall be prescribed
in each State by the Legislature thereof?) nor state law stopped the rigging of the 2020 vote.
Michigan sent ?unsolicited absentee-voter ballot applications by mail to all 7.7 million registered
Michigan voters?without signature verification as expressly required? by state law. The Wisconsin
Elections Commission approved setting up to 500 unmanned ballot drop boxes in major Democratic
cities in violation of Wisconsin law. That commission and local election officials encouraged all
Wisconsin ?voters to unlawfully declare themselves ?indefinitely confined??which under Wisconsin
law allows the voter to avoid security measures like signature verification and photo ID
requirements? as the Texas Attorney General noted in a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that election officials acted illegally but that did nothing to nullify the
hundreds of thousands of votes that came in via illicit loopholes. Biden carried Wisconsin by 20000
votes.
To stifle controversy over electoral rule changes Biden?s media allies created a fairy tale. A week
after Election Day the New York Times ran a banner headline across the top of the front page:
?Election Officials Nationwide Find No Fraud.? How did the Times know? Their reporters basically
called election officials in each state and asked ?Did y?all have any fraud?? A total lack of fraud inan election with more than 100 million voters would have required divine intervention to achieve.
Biden?s 2020 victory became the election equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. A Washington
Post headline scoffed that anyone who doubted Biden?s victory was an ?Election Denier??placing
them in the same odious category as Holocaust deniers. An ABC News analysis portrayed distrust
of the election results as a form of mental illness.

Most of the American media pretended that voter fraud was so rare that the mere suggestion of its
occurrence was a heresy against democracy. But a few weeks after Biden was sworn in as
president a federal investigation revealed that the U.S. government bankrolled some of the most
brazenly corrupt elections in modern times. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction (SIGAR) issued a report titled ?Elections: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in
Afghanistan? that should have received far more attention in Washington and beyond. SIGAR
revealed that the net result of 15 years of U.S. pro-democracy assistance was that Afghanistan?s
2019 presidential election was ?the most corrupt the country had ever held.? U.S. tax dollars poured
into the coffers of Afghanistan?s Electoral Complaints Commission to safeguard voting but that
agency was a prime source of the most shameless vote stealing. U.S. aid enabled the Afghan
government to purchase sophisticated electronic voting systems. But SIGAR?s report warned that
?because governments often control electoral commissions and the procurement of election
technology they are well placed to use it to commit fraud.? SIGAR ruefully noted ?The true
purpose of adopting election technologies may not be to actually reduce fraud but to create the
illusion of doing so.? A U.S. Army colonel who deployed several times to Afghanistan told SIGAR
that as early as 2006 the Afghan government had ?self-organized into a kleptocracy.? Officials who
were stealing everything else never hesitated to steal votes. The collapse of democratic legitimacy
paved the way for the collapse of the U.S. puppet regime in Kabul in August 2021.The Biden administration sought to exploit Covid-era precedents to turn America into a Drop Box
Democracy where minimal efforts by voters automatically sanctify maximum power for politicians. In
2021 the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1 the For the People Act to force all states to
adopt the most unreliable electoral procedures used during the pandemic. The bill which failed in
the Senate would have compelled all future federal elections to permit paid ballot-harvesting and
universal mail-in voting prohibit checking voter identification and require states to count ballots that
arrive ten days after an election. Many of the same Democrats who championed Covid vaccine
passports which disproportionately barred blacks from restaurants and gyms also insist that
requiring voters to show identification is Jim Crow at its worst.
Histrionics and shenanigans continue to be the Democrats? preferred substitute for election
integrity:
Kamala Harris objected to voter identification requirements because she bizarrely claimed it was
?almost impossible? for rural voters to photocopy their identification papers.
The city of Detroit responded to a Republican National Party Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request for ballot drop box surveillance footage by claiming that the footage had been deleted?after
the FOIA request was received. Detroit was notorious for shrouding its vote counting on Election
Night 2020 blocking poll watchers from witnessing Biden?s miraculous comeback.
In Georgia Judge Thomas Cox on Wednesday struck down the Georgia State Election Board?s
new rules to require video surveillance of ballot drop boxes and to regulate ballot-harvesting.
Lawsuits are proceeding regarding lax standards for absentee mail-in ballots in North CarolinaMichigan Pennsylvania Texas and elsewhere.
Preventing bogus ballots should not be treated like a moral or theological issue. When did verifying
votes become a crime against democracy? Why is the Justice Department crusading to turn voting
into an entitlement program for non-citizens? Do Democrats seek to make the actual voting as
fraud-ridden as politicians? campaign promises? Elections need rigorous safeguards against fraud
because as Thomas Paine warned long ago ?the trade of governing has always been monopolized
by? the most rascally individuals of mankind.? Four presidential elections since 2000 have been
heavily tainted by allegations of foul play. American democracy has zero legitimacy to spare at this
point.",The American Conservative_The_Democrats’_Three-Decade_War_on_Honest_Voting.pdf.pdf,news_articles
208,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Doctrine of ?Kamalism?
Kamala Harris became a presidential nominee without winning a single vote. Because she was
handpicked by the Democrat Party establishment not its voters we now know her core beliefs are
the Democrat Party?s core beliefs: Kamalism.
Just two months away from the general election Kamala Harris won?t define Kamalism but her
long record of radicalism already does.
Advertisement
Kamalism is an attempt to destroy America by obliterating the Constitution tearing down the border
and tossing out basic American principles like legal equality.
Kamalism is the reason FEMA has spent over $1 billion on illegal migrants in two years and it?s
why DHS Secretary Mayorkas is now telling Americans that FEMA?does not have enough funds to
make it through the [hurricane] season.?
It?s why roughly 15 million illegal aliens have crossed our border and why the administration hopes
to send left-wing groups nearly $10 billion a year to facilitate the border crisis.
Kamalism has destroyed American innovation and set American tax dollars on fire. It?s worth
examining the reasoning behind it and how it operates in detail.
In 2020 while running alongside Joe Biden the Harris campaign released a video titled ?There?s a
big difference between equality and equity.? According to the narrator Kamala Harris ?The problem
with that [equality] not everyone is starting out at the same place."" Equity is superior because itensures everyone winds up ?at the same place.? Equal outcomes the false ideal promoted by Karl
Marx and Joseph Stalin is the goal of Kamalism.
Advertisement
In 2021 the Biden-Harris administration set aside $42.5 billion for a program to increase high-speed
internet access in rural areas. To receive these grants applicants must meet guidelines issued per
E.O. 13985 which was issued in January 2021 to advance ?equity? across the entire government.
Grant applicants must agree to climate change mandates pledge to hire union workers and check
several other Kamalist requirements. After three years not a single home or business has gained
access to high-speed broadband. That is Kamalism in action.
Likewise the Biden-Harris administration aims to finish building half a million electric vehicle
charging stations by 2030. But program applicants can?t start building until after they?ve submitted
lengthy reports about equity and ?underserved community involvement.? After almost three years of
work the administration has built a grand total of seven stations. One Department of Transportation
staffer said Kamalism is ?screwing everything up? and ?it?s all a mess.?
Biden and Harris earmarked $6 billion this year for climate funding and conditioned it on an array of
inclusivity requirements. Climate grant applicants must submit a ?Community Benefits Plan?
explaining how they will advance diversity equity and accessibility and implement the Justice 40
initiative which requires 40% of federal investment to aid disadvantaged communities. Yes even
efforts to stop climate change must prove they are aligned with Kamalism.
Kamalism is the idea that the government should be at war with regular Americans. According to
Kamalism they don?t deserve to be helped. They must pledge fealty and be reshaped ordestroyed.
One of our two major party nominees is in an undeclared war with everyday Americans and the
American way of life. Every four years commentators describe the current election as ?the most
important of your lifetime.? This one really is.",The American Conservative_The_Doctrine_of_‘Kamalism’.pdf.pdf,news_articles
209,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Domino Theory Refuses to Fall
The recent debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and the former President Donald Trump
focused relatively little on foreign affairs. This was probably a good thing as when the conversation
finally did turn to foreign policy both candidates reiterated an inherited and widespread belief that
protecting vital U.S. interests depends on the perception that America is willing to wage war no
matter how minor the interests powerful the adversary or distant the battlefield.
This shibboleth of the foreign policy elite is a version of the ?domino theory? which stipulated 50
years ago that if Vietnam fell to communism other more strategically significant states would soon
follow. The experience of the Vietnam War and its aftermath should have disabused Americans of
this superstition. Policymakers afraid to lose face by admitting victory was impossible pointlessly
wreaked destruction on Southeast Asia.
Advertisement
Vietnam ultimately fell to communism and the United States was humbled yet the other
?dominoes??Japan South Korea Thailand Indonesia etc.?didn?t fall. Instead Vietnam soon
found itself at war with communist Cambodia and China. Over subsequent decades Vietnam
developed normal diplomatic relations and strong economic ties with the United States and is now
considered by Washington to be an important partner to counterbalance China.
The lure of domino theory however remains deeply ingrained among the foreign policy elite and the
commentariat. Two examples from last week?s debate demonstrate its persistence.
The first came when former president Trump criticized the Biden administration for the Afghanistan
withdrawal?something Trump himself had promised as president?calling it ?the most embarrassingmoment in the history of our country? and claiming the withdrawal was ?why Russia attacked
Ukraine.?
The second example was when Harris for her part claimed that had Trump been president when
Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 he would have appeased and emboldened Putin out of his desire
for ?friendship.? Harris asserted that ?Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine? and remarkably
that had Trump been in office ?Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of
Europe?starting with Poland.?
Politicians? interests are primarily domestic not international in nature. There is little patience for
foreign policy views more complicated than aphorisms that can fit on a cocktail napkin like ?peace
through strength? or ?appeasement emboldens aggressors.?
Advertisement
These often misleading axioms are received from their advisors and policy-planners who have both
ideological and careerist motivations to maintain a U.S. foreign policy of global hegemony what
Stephen Walt has called ?a full employment policy for the foreign policy elite.? For their part
commentators and media figures transform these myths into pearls of conventional wisdom
amplifying self-serving rationales for American primacy. Dissenting views are increasingly either
crowded out deemed ignorant or simply shouted down.
A recent example is former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice?s new cover article in Foreign
Affairs. Despite being one of the principals responsible for the disastrous Iraq War as a member of
the Bush administration Rice has lost no prestige or credibility on Olympus. Instead she is given
top billing in America?s most prestigious foreign policy magazine to warn against ?the perils ofisolationism.? According to Rice unless the United States accepts the humble and selfless task of
dominating the world China and Russia will launch wars of conquest ?illegitimate? regimes will
?sustain? themselves (i.e. remain un-invaded or un-couped by the U.S.) Saudi Arabia and Israel
will never become pals America?s economy will tank and pirates will terrorize the seas. This is all
nearly as scary as Saddam?s WMDs.
Strategy is all about distinguishing vital from superfluous ends in order to apply the limited means at
hand toward what is most valued. Among most of those who direct or influence our foreign policy
however strategy is instead equated with drawing implausible causal connections between
disparate and unrelated phenomena making everything a priority and setting no price too high.
There is plenty of scholarship disputing this ideology. ?Dominoes? rarely fall and capable states
rarely bandwagon with aggressors out of fear of abandonment by allies. States don?t judge the
credibility of others? commitments by past actions under separate circumstances but according to
their perceived capabilities and interests. As scholars from Paul Kennedy to Robert Gilpin have
noted diplomatic compromise?often smeared as ?appeasement??is often a successful strategy
cutting deals with rivals to avoid a worse outcome. For example the United States and United
Kingdom previously enemies avoided war and began their transatlantic love affair after the latter
?appeased? the former by accepting their hegemony in the Western Hemisphere at the end of the
19th century.
As Upton Sinclair once said however ?it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his
salary depends on his not understanding it.?
If your theory of international politics says you must be willing to fight for anything anywhere
against anyone you will probably be compelled to fight for everything everywhere againsteveryone. Looking at the scope of the United States? present international military entanglements it
appears that the domino theory is alive and well. As the United States and its allies stare down the
prospect of a direct conflict with Russia Iran or China (or perhaps all three at once) it?s time to
ditch our national superstition about falling dominoes and instead reappraise what really matters
most both at home and abroad.",The American Conservative_The_Domino_Theory_Refuses_to_Fall.pdf.pdf,news_articles
210,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Freedom Party
Nine years after Donald Trump expressed the emerging ethos of the American right in a single
imperative statement??Make America great again??the Democratic Party has found its rejoinder.
Tim Walz the governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris?s running mate has popularized a similarly
direct command: ?Mind your own damn business.? More than a mere campaign slogan it sums up
an entire political vision. It suggests exactly what kinds of freedom Americans can expect to enjoy in
a blue America?and what forms they can?t.
At the most immediate level the statement expresses the Democratic Party?s uncompromising
defense of abortion rights. Kamala Harris has refused to endorse any limits on the procedure. As
governor of Minnesota Walz signed a bill that repealed a ban on coercing a woman into having an
abortion. When Democrats say they oppose limits on abortion they really do mean it.
Advertisement
But Walz?s statement has a broader application as the candidate himself has made clear. At a
recent campaign stop in Bethlehem PA Walz presented the Democratic Party as the true heir of
some of the more libertarian impulses of yesterday?s GOP.
?There was a time when Republicans talked about freedom they actually meant it. In the long-ago
time it feels like? he told the crowd. ?Because right now when they talk about freedom the freedom
of government to be able to invade your bedroom the freedom of government to invade your examroom the freedom of government to invade your school libraries.?
Along with this strange celebration of yesterday?s GOP?a move symbolized by the Harris
campaign?s loving embrace of the Cheney family?Walz?s statement is notable for its bizarre
warning that Republicans want the government to ?invade your school libraries.? Given that these
libraries exist in governmental institutions?namely public schools?the government can hardly be
said to be invading them. It?s a statement as jarring as the old Tea Party slogan ?Keep your
government hands off my Medicare.?
In both cases the seemingly incoherent statement expresses a consistent political view. The Tea
Party protester?s cry can be understood as a claim that entitlements are not so much government
programs funded by current revenues as a kind of national pension system. As a budgetary matter
this idea is simply false. But it has always been at the heart of the program?s popular appeal. As
FDR told one of his advisers ?We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors
a legal moral and political right to collect their ? benefits. With those taxes there no damn politician
can ever scrap my social security program.?
Similarly the idea that voters have no right to say what books should appear in the libraries of the
schools they pay for seems at first glance utterly confused. But it reflects a belief that public
schools should conform to the will of trained experts rather than that of local constituencies. In this
sense keeping government out of schools really means keeping the popular will out of schools. It is
a statement of opposition to democratic accountability. One can object to this view as inconsistentwith our political traditions but it has its own internal logic.
Advertisement
Indeed the Democratic Party?s thoroughgoing embrace of rights language tends to take a whole
range of contentious subjects out of the realm of political contestation. A right can?t be subject to
political horse-trading. It can?t be debated by the local school board. It must be recognized no
matter what the people say. This may be justified in any given case. But modern liberalism?s
reliance on what the legal scholar Mary Ann Glendon has called ?rights talk? is one element of its
anti-democratic tendency.
This dynamic should affect how we understand the Democratic Party?s claim to be the ?party of
government.? It?s certainly true that the Democrats are more likely to support public programs and
public institutions than Republicans are. But there is a lingering question about who these
institutions are actually serving. When children are graduating without the ability to read books is it
more accurate to say that the purpose of these institutions is education or that their purpose is to
serve as a jobs program for teachers and administrators?
Republican politicians point to these problems as a reason to slash government services abolish
federal departments and lean on private alternatives. In education this approach has met with
some real success as the rise of homeschooling (detailed in a recent report from the Johns Hopkins
School of Education) has shown. In other areas however starving the beast is likely to prove a less
appealing solution. In the face of a national crisis like Hurricane Helene citizens want a vigorous
response from the executive. That requires funding FEMA not abolishing it and making sure itactually serves the interests of Americans.
Whichever party manages to assume the mantle of efficient government?of public services that
actually benefit the public?will have a chance to build a true governing majority. Such a party will
have to embrace democratic accountability even when it?s tempting to say ?mind your own damn
business.?",The American Conservative_The_Freedom_Party.pdf.pdf,news_articles
211,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Roots of the Trump Assassination Attempts
In many Third-World countries falling out of power means being declared an enemy of the people
who needs to be done away. In some situations that means trumped-up charges and made-up
evidence?lawfare?to mislabel the fallen leader as evil and justify the life sentence he receives. In
other situations jail is not secure enough such as when the fallen leader still has many supporters.
That means he must be killed.
The murder can be a well-planned assassination an ?accident? or true up-against-the-wall
execution. It?s all necessary for the greater good especially if the nation wants to claim higher goals
at work?for example saving itself from a worse fate like loss of ?democracy.? Dictators in power
are democracy advocates and dictators out of power are fascists infidels and enemies of the
people.

Donald Trump is an enemy of democracy itself says the left in writing and from the debate stage. It
is then not surprising when people often mentally ill enough to accept the base argument that
someone who served four years as president who defeated multiple impeachment attempts without
resorting to tanks on the Capitol lawn and who has run via the electoral system for president three
times is not a believer in democracy.
Would-be killers have seen lawfare fail. Of course it did; it was based on in one instance the
manipulation of the justice system to transform a payoff to a porn star as part of a legal
nondisclosure agreement from a simple misdemeanor (if that) into 34 separate felonies. In another
instance the lawfare was so weak an attempt on the candidate that a single woman?s vague
testimony from decades earlier was enough to convict him and fine him enough to bring him nearbankruptcy?all enabled by a Covid-era legal device revitalizing charges long past their statute of
limitations.
In other instances the lawfare was too thin to even hurt. Trump once faced 91 charges in four
jurisdictions. Now he faces 12. He?s been convicted on the 34 noted above and seen 45 charges
dismissed. The remaining charges face their own challenges after the Supreme Court determined in
July that Trump has broad immunity from prosecution for actions undertaken while in office. As in
most Third-World countries the lawfare was executed by clumsy but politically loyal amateurs
relying on home-turf advantage to overcome their weak cases. And speaking of democracy lawfare
to date has also been defeated (convictions alone don't matter when the goal is political destruction)
by some judges still willing to uphold the ideals of a fair system and dismiss unfair charges.
With lawfare essentially failing off the table it is time to demonize Trump to create a manifesto for
the mentally ill American who will carry out the grim final round.
The New Republic has duly warned us that ?Donald Trump is warning that 2024 could be
America?s last election??if Trump wins American democracy is over. ?If we don?t win on
November 5 I think our country is going to cease to exist. It could be the last election we ever
have? Trump himself said and he would never joke or exaggerate right?
Advertisement
In another number from the New Republic a writer concluded
The election cycle either ends in chaos and violence balkanization or a descent into a modern
theocratic fascist dystopia. Trump will... use every means available to achieve an America with noimmigrants no trans people no Muslims no abortion no birth control Russian-style ?Don?t Say
Gay laws? license to discriminate based on religion and all government education funding going to
religious schools. Blue states will try to resist this and invoke the same states? rights and ?dual
sovereignty? arguments but it?s unlikely they will succeed due to conservative bias on the Supreme
Court and the Trump administration?s willingness to blow off court rulings it doesn?t like. If Trump
goes straight to a massacre via the Insurrection Act civil war is on the table.
?Putin does what [Trump] would like to do? Hillary Clinton has said. ?Kill his opposition imprison
his opposition drive journalists into exile rule without any check or balance. That?s what Trump
really wants.?
In short says the Washington Post ?a Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable. We should stop
pretending.?
And what politics of fear round-up would be complete without Trump?s misquoted out-of-context
?Now if I don?t get elected it?s gonna be a bloodbath for the whole?that?s gonna be the least of it.
It?s going to be a bloodbath for the country?? Somewhere after that comes a mention from the left
of how our system of bypassing the popular vote in favor of the Electoral College is undemocratic
even if it has resulted in a democracy each and every time it has been used since the Founders
created it. There are a lot of grievances triggers and dog-whistles to hit.
An element of ?Trump is Hitler? has always been missing Trump?s own version of Mein Kampf.
Hitler was famous for writing (from prison) exactly what he planned to do once he gained power.
Now there is Project 2025 a document disavowed numerous times by Trump that pundits from the
left (and the Democratic candidate herself) nevertheless claim is Trump?s nefarious blueprint for a
second term. Trump?s team did not write Project 2025 and he has not cited it in his speeches but itis stuck to him by the Left like tar.
And as a call to arms Larry Diamond a senior fellow at Stanford?s Hoover Institution said that
democracies with their strong protections for civil liberties and the rule of law don?t drop dead of a
heart attack. Instead they die slowly incrementally poisoned at the roots by the fear and anger
instilled by demagogues?like Trump. Adam Kinzinger wrote on X ?MAGA pretending they didn?t
light this fire is gaslighting to the 100th power.? For those who need more intellectual backup to
calling for murder welcome Jonathan Chait who wrote ?Donald Trump Is a Threat to Democracy
and Saying So Is Not Incitement.?
It?s OK they seem to say because Trump asked for it. ""He?s worth killing"" is the broader message.
?I believe that more Americans have to be willing to endure what frankly is discomforting and to
some extent kind of painful to take him at his word and to be outraged by what he represents? said
Hillary Clinton. ?We can?t go back and give this very dangerous man another chance to do harm to
our country and the world.?
Unlike in the Third World there will be no hand-picked assassin here. There is also no conspiracy
per se to assassinate Trump. Instead the left bets that if they send out enough signals someone
mentally ill enough in armed America will do what they want in their hearts. It is the patriotic thing to
do like time-travelers smiting baby Hitler. A jihad.
The left is too coordinated in its words and actions not to know what it is doing. Trump knows it;
during his debate with Harris he remarked that he took a bullet to the head for some of her remarks
that he is anti-democratic. Trump?s would-be assassin knows it claiming that ?democracy is on the
ballot.?What happens next sadly seems to revolve around luck. It was by hair?s breadth away in Butler
Pennsylvania that the Trump rally did not end with a ?back and to the left? blood- and
brain-splattered scenario. It was luck that a lone Secret Service agent spotted a gun barrel poking
out of cover from the perimeter of the Mar-a-Lago golf course and fired to prevent the killer from
getting off a round. Next time? In the face of so many sparks being thrown into so much tinder how
much more luck can Trump count on to see him through to Election Day?",The American Conservative_The_Roots_of_the_Trump_Assassination_Attempts.pdf.pdf,news_articles
212,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Silver Lining in the Stormy 2024 Presidential Election
There?s going to be a presidential election in a couple weeks but few think that we?ll know for sure
the next president on November 5?what used to be known quaintly as ?Election Day.?
Most likely it?s going to be weeks maybe even months before we see a victor. And here?s a
prediction: The Sturm und Drang will come in five phases: litigation negotiation discreditation
devolution and then monetization. I can explain.
Advertisement
First litigation. ?The lawfare election??that was the October 15 headline in POLITICO?s
?Playbook? newsletter. ?The Harris campaign is already involved in dozens of lawsuits?one official
we spoke with last night boasted about winning nine out of ten cases that have already been
decided?while assembling what they are calling the ?biggest voter protection operation in
presidential campaign history.? Hundreds of lawyers are on call for Harris in all 50 states.?
Donald Trump too has lawyers. So billable hours will pile upon pro bono time and a thousand
litigious nightshades will bloom.
All this litigating of course will occur in the context of photo ops press conferences protests and
every other kind of political performance art?peaceful mostly peaceful or outright violent.
And did I mention that Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in New York City on November 26 for
those 34 felonies? If Trump seems to have won the election New York will stand down in deference
to the president-elect?or will it? If Empire State Democrats have worked this hard to prosecute
Trump out of the presidency will they suddenly give up? Miss a chance maybe darkly to?Epstein? Trump in jail? (Those who think it can?t happen to Trump might grapple with how it did
happen to Epstein.)
There?s no way to know who will prevail in the many legal battles. On the one hand Democrats
have a deeper bench of law schools Naderites and ACLUs. On the other hand Republicans have
the Federalist Society a new crop of Aileen Cannons and those justices on the Supreme Court.
Advertisement
But of course all the legal skirmishes must translate into electoral votes for someone; these are to
be tallied on December 17. Yet even if that date isn?t overridden somehow we can ask: Will every
presidential elector be faithful to his or her duty? After all there?ve been plenty of ?faithless
electors? in the past. Yes in 2020 the Supreme Court ruled that a faithless can be replaced by a
faithful. But what if the replacement process breaks down for some reason?
We are reminded: Much of our current system depends on trust. If that erodes there?s not much
left.
So now we come to the second part of our sequence negotiation. We saw plenty of haggling and
horse-trading in the 1876 presidential election when dueling slates of electors Republican and
Democratic presented themselves in four states. Congress couldn?t resolve the disputes and so
kicked it over to a commission which wheeled and dealed wined and dined?and then picked
Rutherford B. Hayes as the victor on March 2 1877 a full four months after Election Day.
Of course we saw something similar wannabe electors in 2020. Only this time around 24 of them
have been indicted. Will that prosecutorial brushback convince Republicans not to do dueling slatesin 2024? Perhaps. But a lot depends on who GOPers think is going to win in the end.
We should keep in mind that all this electoral-college proceduralism will be happening in the
presence of billionaires many of whom are uh deeply invested in the outcome and so may wish to
do all they can to clinch it for their candidate. Would any fatcat engage in monetary importuning
which some might call bribing? Yes we?d be shocked shocked if that were to happen?and in any
case that?s what middlemen are for. Once again a lot depends on who is deemed to be the victor.
It?s a good bet that nobody on the winning team will be punished for securing the win.
There are still more pressure points to be negotiated. On January 6 2025 Congress is scheduled to
certify the electoral college result. But what if that doesn?t happen? What if one party controls one
or both chambers and doesn?t choose to anoint a candidate it doesn?t like? To read the 12th
Amendment and the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 is to wander into a devil?s playground of
possibilities. According to the 2022 law Congress can vote to challenge the results if one-fifth of
both chambers makes the request (how hard will that be?) and could reject the results if it finds that
?one or more electors has not been regularly given? (once again how hard will it be to assert that?).
If Congress deadlocks it?s possible that the next president could be? the Speaker of the House. So
political players should keep the names ?Johnson? and ?Jeffries? on their bingo cards.
The lesson is that it?s hard to write a law to cover every possible circumstance especially if players
are not playing in good faith and especially too if they think a victory by the other side is
Götterdämmerung.
Speaking of Germans or at least German-Americans Donald Trump sure seems to see his
opponents in Schmittian terms. They are ?enemies of the people? he says ?evil??and he?s justgetting started.
As for the Democrats as they tear into Trump they tag him as the worst kind of Teuton. Back in
January I wrote for The American Conservative ?The Trump-as-dictator even Trump-is-Hitler

circumstances is akin to putting an American Führer in power. No Democrat sitting in the West Wing
wants to risk being remembered as a dupe as an American Hindenburg.?
In the ten months since has Trump mellowed? Have the Democrats (and others) softened their view
of the man? Of course not. Yet through it all Trump?s approval rating is sometimes higher than
Harris?s. We?re dealing with two high-negative figures.
So now to the third part of our quintet discreditation. Beyond the presidency the disrepute of the
federal government is hardly a new concept and yet a recent Edelman poll surveying 25 countries
shows it in a new light. When the respective publics were asked about their trust in their central
government the range was 77 percent to 21 percent; the U.S. rating was 40 putting us eighth from
the bottom.
If we wish to we can step away from polls and simply ask: Which aspect of Uncle Sam?s oeuvre do
Americans think is working well? The border guarders? The Gaza pier builders? The federal
school-bathroom enforcers? The FEMA storm relievers?
If Americans don?t trust the federal government then it will probably shrink starved for lack of
confidence; it?s no accident that both Trump and Harris talk more about tax cuts than spending
increases.So from discreditation we move to the fourth part devolution. To see how this could work we can
look back again to the 1876 presidential election the one that took four months to resolve. The gist
of the deal that gave Hayes the White House was the withdrawal of federal troops from the South:
the end of Reconstruction.
To put those events another way they were a major diminishment of federal power a major
enhancement of state power?devolution.
The Compromise of 1877 is not remembered kindly by most historians as it led to the suppression
of freedmen in the South and yet at the time it was regarded as a plausible settlement. For their
part Republicans were weary of Reconstruction and mindful of its political cost to them. In the 1874
midterm elections during the scandal-plagued administration of GOP President Grant the
Democrats had won back the House a startling comeback for the Johnny Rebs.
Moreover the Democrats?whose coalition also included fast-growing numbers of Northern
Catholics?won the popular vote in 1876. So Republicans were happy just to keep the presidency.
And for the Democrats the pain of not winning the White House was compensated by Uncle Sam?s
withdrawal from the South enabling them to tighten their dominion over Dixie.
A century-and-a-half later the issues have changed. Thankfully Jim Crow is no longer a thing and
yet federal aggrandizement is very much a concern. Plenty of Americans especially in red states
feel they are in some sort of peonage to the ?Regime? in Washington D.C. That is a Regime of
gun-grabbing electric vehicle-mandating transgender-pushing DEI-imposing bureaucrats and legal
activists.To be sure for every red-stater who hates all this there?s a blue-stater who loves it?the national
polls are that close. The result of this repulsion-attraction dynamic is plenty of energy. For the United
States it?s as if two stars one red one blue are whipping around each other locked in a furious
mutual orbit.
It?s possible that those two stars could collide in 2024?25 and the result could be strife even civil
war. Back in 1861 ?fire eaters? in the South wanted a scrap and Lincoln licked ?em. (Rhett
Butler?s warning to the hotblooded cavaliers at Tara was not heeded.)
Mindful of such awful history disputatious factions within the U.S. should look for a different model.
Somewhere between the status quo and secession?let carnage be the stuff only of Hollywood.
If the memory of the Compromise of 1877 is too freighted perhaps we should think of another
compromise?in a different country in a different year?that changed the status quo peacefully. That
would be 1867 when the Habsburg Empire became Austria-Hungary. Still one country but two
internal systems. Not a perfect solution but given all the fissiparous possibilities a pragmatic one.
Of course knowing what we know we on this side of the Atlantic can strive to do better: An
American e pluribus duo could provide just the right mix of unity and diversity. Already the red
states and blue states have been pursuing different economic strategies. Yet even so we can see a
potentially enveloping win-win: AI?s rushing hunger for energy could bind the blue brain with red
brawn into a grand carbon bargain.
In the meantime a weakened federal government would open up additional opportunities for the
states to do more of what they might wish to do?and if so they could realize their own greatereconomic potential.
Which brings us to the fifth of our five monetization. The 50 states freer to act on their own could
each be a laboratory of democracy. And if they do it right of prosperity.
Successful states will find ways to nurture or attract entrepreneurs and business clusters. Case in
point: Elon Musk a recent transplant from California to Texas. His X site recently relocated with him
to Texas has become the new Fox News?the best place for conservatives to convene.
And oh yes Musk has a rocket company as well as other assets that have much exposure to
federal regulation. Many times in fact Musk has taken to X to vent about the errors of the Securities
and Exchange Commission the Federal Aviation Administration the Fish and Wildlife Service and
the overall dead hand of regulation.
If Trump becomes president Musk?s federal regulatory problems will likely disappear. But what if
Harris is 47? In the meantime Musk has further issues with a state entity the California Coastal
Commission.
Here we can see that Musk?s vulnerability in the Golden State is an opportunity for the Lone Star
State. Quite possibly Musk will have to complete his retreat to Texas which could be his own legal
fortress. Red Republicans in Austin could create the legal citadel?shielding Musk from regulators?he
needs to keep doing his thing. Part of the reward in return would be Texas as the launchpad for the
next million Mars-bound rockets.
A state-based encasement for Musk would end up in court of course but then the key question:
Who are the judges? Are they friendlies or hostiles? Republicans long ago concluded that theincreasingly woke American Bar Association is not to be trusted on judicial selection and so they
turned to the Federalist Society to develop their own judicial farm team drafting only from it.
If Harris wins and Republicans nevertheless end up with a majority in the Senate the 119th
Congress will be a new ballgame judge-confirmation-wise. Texas?s Sen. John Cornyn says that a
GOP Senate simply would not confirm ?radical? judges and that any nominee will have to be the
subject of ?negotiation with us.?
There?s something of an irony that in polarized times divided control of the branches could mean a
kind of coalition government. If so each side of the coalition will have its must-haves. Chances are
in light of his MAGA service Musk?s needs will rank high on the GOP list.
(And yes there?s the question of what Democrats will do to Musk if they win all the marbles
nationally. Will they keep all his contracts with NASA for instance? Musk might be thinking NASA
needs him more than he needs NASA and the current NASA seems to agree. But that?s one of
many matters that could be stress-tested in the years to come.)
Of course if Musk gets special love from Republicans other members of Team Red will want the
same. For instance what of cryptocurrency? Even amidst the floating virtuality of cyberspace
geography will still matter. Why? Because data might be in the cloud but people have to live and
consume somewhere. Wyoming to name one physical place seeks to be a crypto-Switzerland.
In fact Cowboy State sovereigntists have a lot up their sleeves. Mindful that the feds own 48
percent of its land Wyoming Republicans want to repossess some of it for new housing. The green
imperialists in Washington DC will resist of course and so the fight will commence. If and only if
Republicans stick together we could see a dissolution of the properties.This is what monetization could look like as red states claw away economic assets from regulators
and absentee landlords. New frontiers of tycooning and deal-making would open up. To be sure
blue states could have their own version of this bonanza as they fight a red president on matters of
personal and digital freedom.
It?s a simple enough point: Just as splitting the atom releases energy so does devolving the
leviathan.
To be sure it?s some number of jumps from the current litigation mess to the ultimate monetization
prize to the gold at the end of devolution?s rainbow. And events might not unfold this way.
Yet there?s a logic to this unfolding because ideological polarization connects with financial
self-interest to establish a new political equilibrium. And so the current storm clouds could have a
silver lining. Gold too.",The American Conservative_The_Silver_Lining_in_the_Stormy_2024_Presidential_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
213,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Vance Vibe Shift?
It appears with just a little over three weeks to go in the election that the Trump-Vance ticket is
building some momentum. The Republican ticket captured an 10-point lead in Polymarket odds
took important swing state leads in RealClearPolitics polling aggregation and prompted public
concern from leading Democrats. There is a political eternity between now and election day but
halfway through October Republican ?vibes? are decidedly positive.
To date there have been a handful of distinct ?vibes? that have overhung the 2024 election. In the
run-up to the Republican National Convention and certainly after the Butler assassination attempt
Republicans by-and-large felt triumphant. Joe Biden?s fragility Trump?s personal courage and the
public?s sense of national chaos seemed to guarantee impending victory. After Kamala?s coup the
cringeworthy ?brat summer? adrenalized Democrats and delivered marginal polling leads to their
candidates.
Advertisement
As Kamala?s basement campaign carried on into the fall however vapidity was exposed as an
insufficient communications strategy. Polling tightened throughout September and another
down-to-the-wire electoral fight circa 2016 and 2020 felt likely. That was until early October?s
vice-presidential debate which marked the beginning of a fortuitous streak of developments for
Republicans. The current vibe shift which I?ll dub the Vance vibe shift renewed early-summer?s
prospects of a comfortable Republican win.
The vice-presidential debate was a rough one for Democrats. Tim Walz who carried the manner of
a deer in headlights failed to reassert his campaign?s narrative that Senator J.D. Vance is ?weird.?
He instead spent a considerable portion of the night agreeing with Vance subtly discrediting themedia?s crafted narratives of extremism. Vance?s relatable persona and command of the issues by
contrast carried the night for the GOP. Though no polling implied that Vance swayed a critical bloc
of voters with his performance elite media?s subsequent praise for Vance seemed to trigger a
strategy change inside of the Harris campaign. The New York Times called Vance?s performance
?dominant.? POLITICO dubbed it a ?very midwestern debate? before conceding that ?Vance won.?
The Harris campaign?s ongoing media blitz consisting mostly of eyeroll-inducing softball interviews
started within days of these Vance-friendly headlines.
The Harris campaign committed to a litany of traditional cable appearances including 60 Minutes
The View and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Notably Harris started to branch out into
non-traditional media making an appearance on the crass but popular Call Her Daddy podcast
among other programs. Harris?s struggles in the polls immediately following immense media
exposure suggests that sunlight may be the GOP?s best disinfectant. After two election cycles
Vance?s debate forced the DNC out of the ?basement? and back into the sunlight.
Barack Obama?s recent comments at a Democratic field office in Pittsburgh reflect liberal unease.
Obama warned a smattering of volunteers that ?based on reports I?m getting from campaigns and
communities is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of
our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running.?
Obama added the problem ?seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.? Recent polling does
suggest that black men in particular are breaking towards the Trump camp in unusual numbers.
They are joining Arab Americans and a steady stream of Latinos in their exit from the Obama
coalition. Weakness with previously dependable electoral blocs combined with decreased mail-in
ballot requests in Pennsylvania provide good reasons for the 44th president?s concern. Left
unstated was the incumbent president?s muddle in the southeast a region that now understandsthat FEMA?s disaster relief is a tertiary concern for an administration miring the United States in two
overseas conflicts. Clearly the Democratic Party?s electoral woes are many.
Given Donald Trump?s decade-long tenure as the media?s public enemy no.1 it?s doubtful we'll
see any politically damning information about him emerge in the coming weeks. October surprises if
they mean anything in our fractured media environment are likely to break for Trump?s benefit at
this stage of his political saga. Discounting possible Israeli strikes in Iran which will spiral in
unknowable ways there are no obvious developments that could alter Trump?s current momentum.
Still a political eternity remains before November 5. Harris is continuing to consolidate her gains
with white college-educated voters. Abortion remains a tough political topic for the GOP. Polling and
prediction models are hardly wholly reliable and campaigns tend to make mistakes. But self-inflicted
wounds or egregious polling misses notwithstanding the Trump ticket is in a better position today
than it was in 2016 or 2020. The race is still too close to predict with confidence but with three
weeks to go conservatives have much to cheer.",The American Conservative_The_Vance_Vibe_Shift.pdf.pdf,news_articles
214,Conservative,The American Conservative,"The Vibes Have Run Out For Kamala
Well we now know why Vice President Kamala Harris?s campaign wasn?t eager to rush her out in
front of the cameras for media interviews.
Sitting with the ladies of The View which is hardly entering the lions? den for a Democrat (even the
primary conservative co-host is a Harris supporter) she promptly produced a clip tailor-made for a
Donald Trump campaign ad. Asked if there was anything she would have done differently than
departing President Joe Biden over the last four years Harris replied ?There is nothing that comes
to mind.?
Advertisement
Harris cleaned up a bit by repeating that she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet. She
appears to believe that Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger or at least their fans are the most coveted
swing voters in this election. Perhaps she is correct though the liberal replies to a Washington Post
reporter?s social media post about this exchange were fairly unhinged.
Confronted about the woeful Biden-Harris record at the border on 60 Minutes the vice president had
no real answer as to whether the administration had been too lax for most of its term. But this
back-and-forth also illustrated the basic fraudulence of her attempts to blame the border on Trump
killing a flawed Senate bill she has been pushing.
Biden was able to bring down illegal immigration through executive actions without this legislation.
Trump was able to even more substantially reduce the flow at the border without this legislation.
Biden and Harris made certain enforcement and policy choices that were at their discretion. These
as much as the problems in the Northern Triangle that were not resolved by Harris?s diplomacy arethe real ?root causes? of the border crisis.
Harris made plain that her ?solution? to illegal immigration is to have Congress pass an amnesty
bill which she noted that she and Biden had proposed upon taking office. That proposal along with
ending Trump policies like Remain in Mexico and restoring catch-and-release for apprehended
migrants also incentivized much illegal immigration. Migrants believed if they could make it into the
United States under Biden and Harris they had a better chance of being allowed to stay than under
Trump.
Then there was Harris?s answer that she owns a Glock as her personal firearm. This specific
weapon choice raises questions about her record on gun control. She has supported handgun bans
and filed an amicus brief arguing against the Supreme Court majority?s position in District of
Columbia v. Heller. Dick Heller was trying to purchase a Glock for self-defense in the nation?s
capital.
Advertisement
One of Harris?s better moments was when she taunted Trump on Howard Stern for not appearing
on 60 Minutes himself. ?Ultimately I do believe that this is an election that is about strength versus
weakness and weakness as projected by someone who puts himself in front of the American
people and does not have the strength to stand in defense of their needs their dreams their
desires? she said.
Even that answer contained a healthy serving of Harris?s signature word salad and it also required a
certain amount of prodding from Stern who has hosted Trump many times over the years before the
shock jock adopted a more woke personae. Harris demonstrated in her one (and likely only) debateof this election cycle that she can deliver canned anti-Trump lines and get under his skin effectively.
Substance is another story.
It?s possible this won?t matter much as the presidential race enters the homestretch. But the
sudden resort to a busier media schedule appears to be a concession that her reprise of the Biden
basement strategy was no longer working.
Harris?s running mate Tim Walz lost the vice presidential debate to J.D. Vance. This was at least
partly attributable to the fact that the Minnesota governor wasn?t doing many media interviews
while Vance was sitting down with hostile hosts regularly. Walz couldn?t do more interviews
because he didn?t want to upstage the top of the ticket.
Even though the public polling still shows the contest a toss-up with perhaps even a slight Harris
edge Democrats are nervous. She?s behind where Biden was at this point in 2020 and the final
results turned out to be closer than the October polling suggested four years ago.
Trump is doing a lot of friendly interviews and podcasts too but we have seen him do hostile
interviews before and he is already more of a known commodity. Even this year the Univision town
hall and sit-down with the National Association of Black Journalists were far riskier for Trump to
agree to than Harris.
To paraphrase James Taylor Harris can run for president but she cannot hide. At least not forever.",The American Conservative_The_Vibes_Have_Run_Out_For_Kamala.pdf.pdf,news_articles
215,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Trump and Zelensky meet in New York
Former President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Friday morning
at Trump tower in New York City. It was the first meeting between the two men in five years when
the pair met at the United Nations General Assembly amid the first impeachment of Trump.
Speaking in front of the gathered press Zelensky said he discussed the details of his Victory Plan
with Trump. ?We thoroughly reviewed the situation in Ukraine and the consequences of the war for
our people? Zelensky stated. ?Many details were discussed. I am grateful for this meeting. A just
peace is needed.?

In a post on X following the meeting Zelensky added: ?We share the common view that the war in
Ukraine must be stopped. Putin cannot win. Ukrainians must prevail.?

September 27 2024
Trump asserted a fair peace deal is possible as he has in the past on the campaign trail. ?We both
want to see this end and we both want to see a fair deal made? Trump remarked. ?It should stop
and the president (Zelensky) wants it to stop and I?m sure President Putin wants it to stop and
that?s a good combination.?Trump pitched himself as the man to broker peace between Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Zelensky. ?We [Zelensky and Trump] have a good relationship and I have a very good relationship
with President Putin. I think if we win we?re going to get it resolved very quickly.?
?I hope we have more good relations with us? Zelensky replied. ?It takes two to tango? Trump
said with a laugh.

The meeting comes at a time when Trump and Zelensky have been increasingly critical of each
other. In an interview with the New Yorker last week Zelensky was critical of both Trump and his
running mate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH). The Ukrainian president labeled Vance as ?too radical? and
suggested Trump is unable to swiftly end the conflict.
?My feeling is that Trump doesn?t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows
how. With this war oftentimes the deeper you look at it the less you understand.?
Likewise Trump was critical of Zelensky?s handling of the war at a Wednesday rally in North
Carolina telling the audience:
Those cities are gone they?re gone and we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who
refused to make a deal Zelensky. There was no deal that he could have made that wouldn?t have
been better than the situation you have right now. You have a country that has been obliterated not
possible to be rebuilt.
The meeting between the two men came a day after Zelensky met with Trump?s Democraticopponent in November?s presidential race Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris used her joint
appearance with Zelensky to criticize various peace plans that have been floated to end the conflict
such as Vance?s peace plan which would see a ceasefire Ukrainian neutrality and the erection of
a demilitarized zone along the current frontlines.",The American Conservative_Trump_and_Zelensky_meet_in_New_York.pdf.pdf,news_articles

specifically called out her support for the Iraq War and asserted that Kamala?s embrace of Cheney

217,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Trump Ripens in the Sun Belt
The former President Donald Trump got some much-needed good news out of the Sun Belt states
this week.
The latest NYT/Sienna polling of the southern region that extends from North Carolina to California
finds Trump leading Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by comfortable margins only a month after
the same poll found Harris holding a sizable advantage in parts of the region.
Advertisement
According to the latest figures Trump has opened leads in Arizona Georgia and North Carolina. In
Arizona Trump now leads Harris by 5 points according to the NYT/Siena figures as voters raise
concerns over the porous border. A Fox News poll released Thursday also found Trump ahead by a
shorter margin of 3 percent.
Immigration is the key issue for voters in Arizona. More than 1 million illegal immigrants are
estimated to have crossed through the Yuma sector alone during Biden?s presidency and Trump?s
campaign has repeatedly sought to attach escalating tensions along the border to Harris. Owing to
the importance of the three states and Arizona specifically Harris is scheduled to visit the
Southwest this weekend as her campaign attempts to pitch her as tough on crime citing the vice
president?s time prosecuting transnational gangs when she served as California?s attorney general.
Whether that message plays is another question altogether. Harris has struggled to shore up what
many voters see as her weakest issue; immigration. And although Harris enjoyed a summer surge in
popularity that has assuaged the worries of many of her Democrat critics she still trails Trump by 14
percentage points on the issue.Trump appears to have made significant inroads with the Hispanic voting base as well. A shocking
newly-released Quinnipiac poll finds Trump ahead of Harris by eight points. That number has been
disputed however by Pew Research Group which found Harris leading by 18. Other critics have
pointed to an Economist poll which finds Harris holding a 28-point advantage over Trump with
Hispanics. Even Trump?s worst-case scenario with the Latino voter block finds him polling stronger
than most Republican presidential candidates of the past. The last GOP standard-bearer who even
came close with the demographic was then-President George W. Bush who lost the bloc to John
Kerry by 18 points in 2004.
More troubling for Harris the Arizona Police Association who represents over 12000 members of
local and statewide law enforcement endorsed Trump for president in late August. The Association
split its endorsement down ballot choosing to back the Democratic candidate for Senate Ruben
Gallego over the MAGA firebrand Kari Lake. Lake?s poor polling numbers and inability to resonate
with centrist voters have yet to drag down Trump?s numbers in the state.
Advertisement
?Donald Trump creates his own weather? noted former Arizona Republican lawmaker Stan Barnes.
Trump?s ability to escape the controversies of his down ballot counterparts will play a significant
part in the North Carolina race where Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson is under
fire for salacious comments he allegedly made on a pornography forum in the early 2000s.
Many of Robinson?s staff have abandoned his campaign and the MAGA flamethrower is down
double digits and falling as he combatively claims the disturbing posts were ?manufactured? byartificial intelligence despite strong evidence to the contrary. Since the allegations broke Trump has
steered clear of the man he once dubbed ?Martin Luther King on steroids? and both his and vice
president nominee JD Vance?s teams have barred Robinson from further campaign events.
According to the NYT/Sienna poll which was conducted before the Robinson scandal hit the wires
North Carolina is the tightest race of the three. The state which went for Trump in 2020 by less than
75000 votes is essentially a toss up and the Harris campaign has spent considerable time and
money in Tar Heel country. Whether that down payment pays off in a state that has consistently
voted Republican for president over the years is yet to be determined.
Trump is also showing strength in Georgia a state President Biden narrowly and controversially
carried in 2020. Not only is Trump ahead in the most recent selection from NYT/Sienna but the
former president is also leading by 2 points according to the latest polling from CBS News. Fox
News countered the bullish narrative in a poll released late on Thursday which found Harris up 3
points in the state.
Voters in the region list rising housing costs as their top concern and that?s good news for Trump
who has consistently polled ahead of Harris on the economy. Harris has attempted to pitch herself
as a pro-labor capitalist who can reinvigorate the middle class but voters remain skeptical of her
ability after four years of rising costs under the Biden-Harris administration.
One area in the Sun Belt that could surprisingly spell trouble for the Trump campaign is in his home
state of Florida a region that no Democratic presidential candidate has captured since Barack
Obama did it back-to-back in 2008 and 2012. Harris is polling better than expected in the Sunshine
State and a just-released survey from The Independent Center and The Bullfinch Group finds the
59-year-old only down by one. That poll comes on the heels of a Florida Atlantic University pollpublished last week which found Harris leading Trump by slim margins.
Harris?s startling strength in the state is likely owed in part to Amendment 4 a November-ballot
initiative to protect abortion rights that could prompt Democrat voters to turn out in big numbers.
Florida currently has a six-week abortion ban that Trump has waffled about first saying he would
vote yes on the ballot initiative before quickly amending his answer after facing backlash from
conservative voters. Similar abortion measures have won approval in politically red areas throughout
the country and the Florida initiative could help Harris pull the sort of numbers that Obama used to
defeat John McCain and Mitt Romney.
On Thursday the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced it would spend millions in
Florida and Texas in an effort to snatch an upset in the reliably red states. Although the incumbent
Sen. Rick Scott looks headed for a comfortable reelection in Florida Sen. Ted Cruz appears
vulnerable in Texas. New polling from Emerson who correctly called a narrow victory for Cruz over
Beto O?Rourke in 2018 finds Democratic Rep. Colin Allred down only 4 points to Cruz with 6
percent of respondents undecided. Trump who defeated Clinton by 9 and Biden by 6 in the
Longhorn State safely holds a 5-point advantage over Harris for the time being.
Nevada and its seven electoral votes are in toss-up territory according to polling aggregator
FiveThirtyEight. The latest Emerson poll from the region finds the two candidates locked in a
statistical dead heat. Trump who lost the state by nearly 3 percentage points in 2020 has
attempted to make inroads with service workers by promising ?no tax on tips.? Harris is scheduled
to campaign in Las Vegas this weekend following her visit to Arizona.
But even if Trump wins every contested Sun Belt state he would still need to pick off a Rust Belt
state to win reelection a task that grows more daunting by the day. Harris who selectedWisconsin?s Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate has shown surprising strength in Michigan
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin since entering the race in late July.
Trump?s stunning 2016 upset victory over Hillary Clinton was largely in part due to his performance
in the Blue Wall states. His sincere message to those struggling to make ends meet in the
bombed-out husk of what was once America?s palatial manufacturing hub rang true in a way that no
other politician on the left or right could enunciate.
Michigan-born filmmaker Michael Moore whose brilliant 1989 film Roger and Me depicted the
economic devastation wrought by the exodus of car manufacturers in Michigan cities such as Flint
understood better than anyone Trump?s appeal to those abandoned by America?s wealthiest:
Donald Trump came to the Detroit economic club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor
executives and said ?If you close these factories as you?re planning to do in Detroit and build them
in Mexico I?m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody is
going to buy them. It was an amazing thing to see. No politician Republican or Democrat had ever
said anything like that to these executives. And it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and
Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit States.
Trump?s 35 percent tariff threat never materialized. In 2019 Trump unexpectedly levied a 5 percent
tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. The decision was heavily criticized by Trump?s own
administration and was quickly scuttled although Trump claimed the measure had abated illegal
immigration.
In a throwback to the 2016 campaign Trump said on Tuesday that he will impose a 100 percent
tariff on all cars imported from Mexico if he is reelected president. ?The only way they'll get rid ofthat tariff is if they want to build a plant right here in the United States with you people operating
that plant? Trump told a crowd in Georgia.
The 100 percent tariff proposal came only a day after Trump flanked by John Deere equipment
threatened the company with a 200 percent tariff if they go through with a plan to move a significant
part of its manufacturing base to Mexico. A spokesperson for the company refuted Trump?s claims
noting that John Deere has had a presence in Mexico since 1952. ?We are not moving to Mexico?
read a tersely-worded missive released in response to Trump?s remarks.
Whether Trump?s tough talk on tariffs resonates with voters remains to be seen. Voters in the Rust
Belt have certainly watched the former president fail to deliver on such promises in the past and his
numbers in the Rust Belt aren?t nearly as positive as the Sun Belt figures show although
Pennsylvania appears to be in play heading into the final stretch.
The shifting nature of the 2024 election is indicative of the sublimely chaotic and rare air Americans
find themselves in today. Late Thursday night a new poll from Bloomberg/Morning Consult put
Harris ahead thinly in all of the swing states. If one thing is certain this race can shift on a dime. For
Trump the hope is he lands heads up at the right moment.",The American Conservative_Trump_Ripens_in_the_Sun_Belt.pdf.pdf,news_articles
218,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Tucker: Do You Really Believe Iran Is a Threat?
They say that when you need something to work most it doesn?t. So when I awoke to hear that
Hurricane Helene had knocked out our power and we had limited cell reception on the day I was set
to interview Tucker Carlson I was worried. I ended up calling him from the parking lot of my favorite
local coffee shop; inclement circumstances aside he did not disappoint making bold and heterodox
arguments about the national interest the state of the country and especially whether America
needs to worry about Iran.
Our conversation began with the usual exchange of pleasantries?a surreal experience having a
voice you?ve listened to for so many years actually respond to you in real time. I asked him to bear
with me saying that I wasn?t a real journalist. The response: a quintessential Tucker laugh. ?No no
it?s quite alright journalists are all loathsome creatures anyway? he said.

Reassured I asked him how he felt his nearly completed tour went and whether it lived up to his
expectations. Like most who have been on long trips individual days and experiences all seemed to
merge together for him but he seemed happy as a whole ?It has been truly incredible? he said.
?Living in a very remote part of Maine I understandably don?t get out that much but I really felt that
I needed to actually be on the ground and see our country and its people.?
I asked what his favorite stop had been. ?Oh Pennsylvania for sure? he replied without hesitation.
?I hunt and fish a lot and outside of its major cities Pennsylvania is unbelievably beautiful and
possibly one of the best places in the country. It?s a shame that they have such a sinister governor
who signs bombs with a grin. Truly evil stuff.?I asked what his interactions with people on the tour had been like. Sounding somewhat dejected
he replied ?There seems to be a lot of chaos a lot of lying going on in our country. I am amazed at
the amount of blatant propaganda that people still believe.? Asked what he meant specifically he
answered ?This stuff with Iran.?
I asked whether he meant the FBI?s assertion that there were teams of Iranian-backed groups in
the US trying to kill Donald Trump. ?You don?t really believe that do you?? he interrupted. I denied
it. ?Okay good. Because you know I?ve been around the block and since 2003 it seems like
everyone in the intel community shouts ?Iran Iran Iran? every time there is a national security
threat? he said. ?It?s truly shocking that people especially those on the right still believe that Iran
is our greatest national security threat.?
I asked Tucker for his reaction to Mark Levin?s recent suggestion that the United States should treat
Iran?s speculated involvement in the assassination attempts on Donald Trump as an act of war. He
scoffed ?That?s truly deranged. Hard to believe and take seriously. Anyone who is repeating this
line about Iran is a liar. Realistically Iran does not want a hot war with the United States and has
tried to avoid one for the last year. It is one of the most sinister lies out there.?

I asked him whether he thought despite Donald Trump?s anti-war posturing and his selection of
J.D. Vance as a running mate the neocon/hawkish wing of the Republican Party had been fully
ousted from influence of the electorate. ?Are you kidding me? We haven?t exorcized the neocon
establishment at all!? he said with a laugh. ?You have to understand though that this is not a
right/left thing. Just look at the second guy who tried to kill Trump. Fundamentally he believes the
same exact things that someone like Bill Kristol David Frum and Victoria Nuland believe.??That?s the scary thing. You have all of these people telling us that Iran Russia North Korea are
the greatest threats to our national security and I just simply don?t believe that? he continued. ?It
really seems at this point that the Democratic Party and the national security establishment are in
fact our greatest threats to national security.?
The national security establishment?the blob?weighs heavily on Carlson these days. ?It?s really
concerning how most Americans don?t understand that we are actually in a hot war with
Russia?right now?and by extension how close we are to nuclear war. It?s embarrassing how many
pundits casually throw around the idea of nuclear exchange but we really have no direct experience
of what that would look like in the 21st century? he said.
By Carlson?s lights the nuclear order is more fragile and if broken more dangerous than it was
during the warmest parts of the Cold War. ?The two examples we do have are completely
antiquated in terms of the tech and potential aftermath that it?s not even comparable? he said.
?What happens if a nuclear bomb hits a nuclear reactor? We don?t know. I?m really fearful it would
set off a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. In a year no one could be alive if we
continue sleep-walking into a wider war with Russia.?
I asked him what he thought about Vance who had spoken at one of Carlson?s tour appearances.
?He was undoubtedly the best and quite frankly the only [vice-presidential] selection. Any other
would bear little if any resemblance to Trump?s voters? he said. ?And look even if I didn?t and
don?t agree with him on every single issue the voters have a right to get what they want. That is
the kind of system we have.?
This gets to the heart of the populist idea. ?We elect people to represent us and our interests whichis why all of the stuff we were just talking about [Iran and Russia] is so baffling to me? Carlson said.
?Like where is the public on this? Where is the outrage that we are sleep-walking into a nuclear
war? People are supposed to own their representatives and representatives need to vote with the
will of the people to earn their consent.?
Hence the problem. ?That is how this is supposed to work but it?s not and that is a real shame? he
continued. ?I guess the only real consolation is that the people that I?ve met on this tour have really
been anti-war anti-violence and are deeply concerned with the current trajectory of U.S. foreign
policy.?
I asked whether he had any predictions about the presidential election. He balked at giving a firm
prediction but said ?Regardless of the outcome we?ve changed so much as a country.?
We both agreed that even 2019 feels like a completely different world. ?The funniest thing to me is
seeing the number of Republicans in group chats I?m in who are supporting the liberal mayor of
New York because of his indictment.? he observed wryly.
He then added unprompted ?You know the best moment in this entire presidential campaign
wasn?t the cat memes or Joe Biden stepping aside but was when Trump announced the other day
that he was going to cap credit card interest rates at 10 percent. That was truly brave! I never send
candidates money but that actually made me consider donating to his campaign.?
I asked him to elaborate. ?It goes to what we were talking about earlier?who is more an enemy of
the American people the Mullahs in Iran or Chase Bank?? he asked. ?It?s just crazy to me that all
Abrahamic religions have prohibitions against usury and somehow we as a society are okay with
banks sending out unsolicited credit card applications to 20-year-olds who are still in college andcharging people 25 to 30 percent interest saddling them with debt for the rest of their lives? We
used to call that loan sharking now I guess it?s just normal.?
I asked him whether there was anything else specifically that had changed noting that it seemed
like ordinary Americans were still too nice and that our ancestors would not have stood for half the
things our government has done the last few decades. ?People aren?t necessarily ?too nice?? he
said. ?They just understandably believe in the system they grew up in.?
?For my generation you were taught that you needed to respect our institutions like the media or the
intelligence community. That is why we voted and paid taxes and why I still do? he continued. ?But
I wonder how many people who were at January 6th had pocket Constitutions and thought they
were defending a system they believed in and who now after seeing what happened still believe in
that system. A lot of people don?t believe in the system anymore and that is not a good thing. I?ve
been in a lot of places where the system has broken down and force is the only thing that rules and
it's not pretty.?
Probing further I asked if that made him worried for the outcome of the election regardless of who
won. ?There is no point in getting all depressed and doomscrolling [sic] about this? he said.
?Everything in life is a mixed bag. Obviously I think it would be better if one side won but looking at
human history there have always been representatives of good and evil and there will be until it
ends.?
I asked what parents should be doing to raise virtuous children in a culture that seems out to corrupt
them and steal their innocence at every turn. ?Having that perspective of reality being a mixed bag
is critical. It is a natural deterrent to ideology and insanity? he said.?Another thing that we have completely forgotten in the West but used to be a hallmark of it is the
idea of loyalty to your family and your wider clan.? he continued adding that parents should foster
that sense of loyalty as a tide against what he called ?substitutions? for family.
?Things are changing though and what people in the last century substituted for family like a
career politics and media are now being reexamined and a lot of people are returning to and
craving the real? he said.
The conversation seemed to be coming to an end. I asked him about books. He said that he loved
them still and that when he had a back injury a few years ago he posted himself up in his family?s
barn where he has some 1200-plus volumes and read for an entire month while he recovered. He is
a fan of P.G. Wodehouse; he said that he tries to avoid reading books published after 1945 as
?most books since then contain nothing but lies.?
Many people have grievances and gripes against Tucker but the one thing that people don?t see is
how genuine and generous he is as a person. Our conversation lasted for about 45 minutes despite
his grueling tour duties all because he wanted to help a publication that he felt was one of the few
that provides real ?intellectual stimulation.? (Which is to say please subscribe!)
Nor was this episode exceptional. In 2017 a few weeks after he had taken over Fox News? 8:00
PM timeslot from The O?Reilly Factor Carlson came to my alma mater to be the keynote speaker at
our annual dinner (a role he filled at the last minute due to scheduling conflicts with the notably
difficult former Vice President Mike Pence). During his visit he spent over an hour privately with us
students fielding sophomoric questions with genuine insight and patience and making a point to
thank the hostesses and kitchen staff at our university for his meal.Perhaps it is this quality more than the intellectual boldness or the quick wit that sets Carlson apart
from his fellows?a certain decency a humanity. Wherever he?s going long may he ride.",The American Conservative_Tucker_Do_You_Really_Believe_Iran_Is_a_Threat.pdf.pdf,news_articles
219,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Walz Is Not My Sort of Midwesterner
Among the myriad reasons not to make Tim Walz the second-most powerful person on the
planet?his radicalism his propensity for overstating his international travels his weirdness?the one
that looms largest in my mind is entirely personal: As a native Midwesterner I do not wish for Walz
to become the standard-bearer of my region.
In the course of his brief stint at Kamala Harris?s running mate Walz?who was born in Nebraska
and is the present Democratic governor of Minnesota?has attempted to make his goofily gregarious
distressingly demonstrative and amiably annoying persona his central selling point.
Advertisement
During the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday when asked to account for his misleading
statements about his proximity to China at the time of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre Walz
was true to his ?just a regular guy who doesn?t know any better? image. ?I?ve not been perfect
and I?m a knucklehead at times? he said possibly becoming the first-major party presidential or
vice-presidential candidate to call himself a ?knucklehead.?
Then trying to mop up after that debate performance Walz again attempted to excuse himself by
implying he was just an ordinary dope. ?Look not bad for a football coach?not bad!? he said
reminding voters yet again that among his qualifications for being second in line to the presidency
was coaching high-school football.
This would be merely amusing in an apocalyptic sort of way were I not an inhabitant of the
geographical region that Walz goes out of his way to represent each time he walks onto a stage or
sits down for an interview. He is making all of us who hail from the Midwest seem like affable rubes.I write here with some authority. My father was from Marion Ohio and my mother was from Sioux
City Iowa. Both were serious smart and sober-minded people. I myself was born in and live
outside of Columbus Ohio. I am personally familiar with the widely agreed-upon virtues of
Midwestern culture: neighborliness commonsensical-ness civic trust enthusiasm for collegiate
athletics especially those played on the gridiron and a high degree of respect for police officers
firemen and snow-plow drivers.
All of this has very little to do with the frenetic hand-waving and brow-furrowing of Tim Walz.
Staidness not zaniness is the quality I would more often associate with Midwesterners including
James Thurber (b. 1894 Columbus) who drew cartoons about listless long-suffering men and
Charles Schulz (b. 1922 Minneapolis) who drew comic strips about depression-inclined
schoolchildren.

In my state the presiding political family for much of the last century were the Tafts who were the
picture of aristocratic understatement. In an anecdote recounted by sociologists E. Digby Baltzell
and Howard G. Schneiderman in the book The Protestant Establishment Revisited the wife of the
future Ohio Republican Senator Robert A. Taft did not attempt to portray her husband then running
for office as just one of the guys: ?He did not start from humble beginnings. My husband is a very
brilliant man. He had a fine education at Yale. He has been well trained for his job. Isn?t that what
you prefer when you pick leaders to work for you?? His grandson the former Ohio Republican
Governor Bob Taft boasted a similar unexciting competency.
These qualities were not unique to Ohio Republicans. Ohio?s Democratic Senator (and formerastronaut) John Glenn had something of this same unpretentious reserve.
But wait you say: Walz does not claim to be a dignified public servant?he?s a former football coach
and therefore entitled to act nutty. I beg to differ. Where I live everybody?s idea of a great football
coach is one Wayne Woodrow Hayes who in his capacity as Ohio State University?s head football
coach had in common with Walz only two things: He was stocky and had white hair. Hayes was a
hard-charging warrior not a giddy follower of woke trends. Let us imagine what Hayes would have
thought of men playing in women?s sports.
Walz seems determined to confirm the coastal elites? opinion of the Midwest as a bastion of poor
taste and tackiness; it?s no coincidence that Jim Gaffigan in his impression of Walz on Saturday
Night Live last weekend said his suit was purchased from Costco. Yet I associate my home region
with the modest courtliness of the Midwestern narrator of F. Scott Fitzgerald?s The Great Gatsby
Nick Carraway who at one point in the novel says this about his homeland: ?That?s my Middle
West?not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling returning trains of my
youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths
thrown by lighted windows on the snow.?
Nowhere in the novel does Carraway describe himself or anyone else as a knucklehead.
Now I have never been to Minnesota or Nebraska. Even so I have known people from both states
and I have never met anyone who is anything like Tim Walz. His hokey dorkiness disqualifies him
from becoming the highest-serving elected official from our region. Kurt Vonnegut once wrote
soaringly of Midwesterners? ?awe for a fertile continent stretching forever in all directions?; Walz
gets laughs for having committed to memory the jingle for Menards. We can do better than this.Happily there happens to be an Ohioan on the Republican ticket this November.",The American Conservative_Walz_Is_Not_My_Sort_of_Midwesterner.pdf.pdf,news_articles
220,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Was Vance?s Debate Victory Enough?
Even more than the Trump?Harris presidential debate the vice-presidential debate between J.D.
Vance and Tim Walz was conducted on progressive terms. From hurricanes to gun control to family
policy to threats to democracy practically every question was asked in a left-wing framework.
This put Vance at a double disadvantage. Not only were the assumptions behind the questions
loaded but Vance is not a typical movement conservative which means he didn?t have the
counter-moves at his disposal that the movement has spent decades developing. When Vance
focused on key Trump themes of immigration and economic nationalism he was sure-footed. But
the free-spending predilections of the New Right and Donald Trump?s wavering on social
conservatism have left next-wave Republican leaders like Vance in something of a no-man?s land.
Advertisement
Vance is smart enough to find his way out but it isn?t easy?and for others it may prove impossible.
If the GOP isn?t fiscally conservative on entitlements or healthcare and isn?t culturally conservative
on abortion where does that leave Republicans when they?re asked about subjects that can?t be
brought back to immigration or strengthening American manufacturing?
The most important parts of a debate are the first 20-odd minutes which casual viewers are most
likely to watch and the closing statements which are most likely to be remembered by those who
slog through the whole thing but don?t have their minds made up beforehand. Vance made a more
favorable impression than Walz right at the start with a more confident presentation than the
Minnesota governor?s halting delivery. Vance had the stronger closing pitch too.
In the opening rounds Walz seemed to have trouble remembering what he wanted to say. Helooked at times like he was surprised to be on stage. He stumbled especially badly when asked to
account for his false claim to have been in China at the time of the Tiananmen massacre. Rather
than own up to a lie Walz took cover behind the clumsiness he?d displayed up to that point in the
debate. Was it hard to believe that a slow-spoken maybe slow-witted fella like Ol? Tim might have
misremembered and misspoken about being present for such an historic event?
Walz is indeed a ?knucklehead? as he later characterized himself. But he?s also fundamentally a
fraud who lies about his China experience his military record and his family?s IVF treatment (his
wife never had any contrary to Tim?s tales).
Vance?s running mate is no stranger to exaggeration and invention of course. The difference is that
the most influential people in the country don?t treat Trump?s lies as truths. Progressives like Walz
and Harris are allowed to get away with it because their lies serve to support the even bigger lies on
which the American ruling class depends?lies like the ones told by all the generals and
national-security ?experts? who have endorsed Kamala Harris and who for decades told the
American people that victory in Afghanistan was mere months away.
Advertisement
As Vance pointed out in the debate experts backing Walz and Harris also promoted the lies and
elite self-deceptions that wound up expanding China?s wealth and power at the expense of our own
industrial workforce. The lies that sustain our wicked and inept ruling class are more consequential
than anything Trump has ever said about his crowd sizes or the 2020 election. The lies many of
Harris?s biggest fans told about Iraq killed thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of
foreign civilians.There were lies or culpably misleading simplifications baked into the questions put to Vance and
Walz by the CBS moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O?Donnell. ?Climate change? for
example is an Orwellian assault on clear language and critical thought: Climate is always changing
of course but those who use this phrase mean to imply that all dramatically bad weather?too hot
too cold too dry or too wet?is a political problem requiring the election of liberals (including liberal
Republicans) as a solution. Vance used the more honest language that Trump prefers referring to
policies aimed at ensuring clean air and water. He argued that if Harris were serious about a
cleaner greener economy Democrats would do more to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.
rather than hampering relatively clean American energy and manufacturing with regulations that
encourage dirtier development in China and elsewhere.
But the moderators? premise was that Americans themselves are responsible for the severity of
hurricanes. Vance didn?t go so far as Trump has gone in the past to question the very premise
which left Walz to offer technical remedies to a seemingly agreed-upon problem.
Vance put a premium on agreeableness which earned him some praise from pundits for the civil
tone of the debate. Vance and Walz frequently expressed a measure of concord on ends if not
policy means. Vance was wise to show the softer side of the Republican ticket since those who
want a candidate who demolishes the polite facades of concentrated power are already voting for
Donald Trump. Vance demonstrated that Trump?s GOP can speak mildly when the time is right. In
this case the moment to talk to those remaining undecided voters who might like what Trump and
Vance have to say but don?t like the way Trump says it.
Walz however took full advantage of the quandaries Republicans have found themselves in as
Trump stakes out a middle ground on abortion and embraces a larger role for government in
providing child support child care for working mothers family leave and in vitro fertilization. Walzand Harris are abortion extremists but they make their case for imposing liberal abortion laws on a
national scale by invoking specific instances of women who have suffered dangerously complicated
pregnancies or miscarriages in abortion-restricting states or who have been victims of incest and
rape. Such extreme examples serve as rationales for extremely open-ended pro-abortion policies
which would not punish abortionists who allow babies born alive to die. Vance interrogated the
specifics of the liberal abortion law that Walz signed in Minnesota and Walz had no answer when
Vance pressed him on the details. But the details of women in tragic circumstances are far more
memorable than the details of legislation and Vance had no sentimental artillery to match Walz?s.
The discussion of child tax credits and other family benefits illustrated another difficulty: What?s to
stop Democrats from outbidding Republicans every time? Democrats are always prepared to offer
more money to more recipients a fact demonstrated by the Harris-Walz ticket?s counter-offer of a
$6000 child tax credit in response to Vance?s campaigning on a $5000 credit. Here too is a
problem of premises. The fundamental principle of progressive politics is that Americans are feeble
and unable to provide for themselves or their families; wise federal administrators must provide for
them. The principle of conservative small-r republican politics by contrast is that those
administrators or experts weaken citizens and families by fostering such artificial dependency. The
best way to care for children is not with federally mandated or subsidized babysitting programs but
by ensuring that good jobs are available for American parents at every level of education.
Vance and Trump understand this but they both face obstacles in communicating it. In Trump?s
case he has a tendency to oversimplify and dramatize which is exactly what he did when he said
the U.S. will take in so much revenue from his tariffs that child care will seem like a small expense.
Although the spirit of Trump?s claim was conservative and republican it was too vague to avoid
raising doubts in voters? minds. Vance is more winking yet that has a downside too as the
possibilities of specific government interventions that might help confuse the basic question ofwhether parents should have to rely on Washington D.C. to raise a family.
The healthcare debate follows a similar track and there too the Republican position is starting to
seem like a watered-down version of what Democrats are offering. If voters want Obamacare will
they vote for Trump and Vance to fix it?or for Harris and Walz to give them more of it? The standard
conservative card to play is to warn of what Harris or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders means for the
private healthcare and insurance most Americans want to keep. It?s not obvious what the new GOP
alternative is.
The CBS moderators confronted Vance with Trump?s remarks from the last presidential debate
about having ?concepts of a plan.? Trump was refreshingly honest when he said that?he wasn?t
offering a technocratic people-pleasing but legislatively implausible answer to a hard problem and
Vance explained that well on Tuesday. Yet the moderators wouldn?t have brought it up if they
didn?t think it was a weakness for Trump and Vance. The Republican ticket doesn?t need the kind
of over-conceptualized policy blueprints that were characteristic of the Mitt Romney campaign a
dozen years ago. But the GOP does need to differentiate its overall approach from the Democrats?.
Again and again the debate returned to left-wing narratives. At one point Norah O?Donnell asked
about ?America's gun violence epidemic the leading cause of death for children and teens in
America is by firearms? a phrasing that cleverly conflates two things?the horrific but rare mass
school shootings that receive overwhelming media attention whenever they happen and the far
more frequent gang-related and non-spree shootings that account for most firearms-related deaths
of minors. (?Teens? are the major component of O?Donnell?s ?children and teens? framing.)
Restrictions on AR-15-style rifles and more background checks will not reduce the major sources of
teen gun violence.Vance tried to correct the false setup behind the question by mentioning both mental illness and
?the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities? as the roots of the problem. Spree
murders are typically the work of deeply troubled young men whose problems are known long
before they can get their hands on a weapon but who are treated leniently rather than stopped
before they can kill. And urban crime is the backdrop to the gun violence that imperils still more
teenagers.
Yet Vance could hardly counter decades of propaganda in the one- or two-minute segments in
which he was allowed to speak. Walz blasted him for daring to mention mental illness as a factor in
school shootings and deflected attention away from violence in urban schools to rural suicides?a
serious problem to be sure but not the driving force in teen firearm deaths nationwide. Under Harris
and Walz law-abiding Americans will find it more difficult to buy guns while criminals will not. For all
that Harris and her running mate claim to enjoy the exercise of their Second Amendment rights their
agenda on guns is very much the same as that of liberal Democrats going back more than 30 years
to the peak of violent crime in America?s cities.
Predictably the January 6 2021 riot at the Capitol was another topic the moderators broached only
from the Democratic Party?s perspective. Vance was asked whether he would accept certification of
the 2024 election and Walz demanded to know whether he?d admit that Trump lost the 2020
election. Vance didn?t take the bait but instead began talking about censorship as a greater threat
to democracy. Here he missed an opportunity however: The two assassination attempts on Trump
this year are the most serious acts of political violence aimed at altering the outcome of an election
that our nation has witnessed in decades. The rule of law meanwhile has been not only harmed but
perverted by the lawfare Democrats have waged against Trump. If American democracy is
endangered Democrats bear much of the blame yet few in the media hold them to any account
certainly not in televised debates.As progressive storylines have become deeply embedded in America?s elite culture?in the media
academy and in both political parties?the GOP has struggled to adapt. Old-style movement
conservatives in the party have ready responses to liberal arguments on guns abortion healthcare
and climate. But these arguments often sound stale and they were developed in an America where
educated voters had not yet become so liberal. Trump?s response to the predicament has been to
cede ground in some places while challenging the elite consensus profoundly on immigration trade
and foreign policy. Some Republican policy wonks meanwhile want to scrap the old conservatism
without embracing Trump?s combativeness and assault on expertise. Vance is aware of the
arguments for all of these courses and he knows they all have their limitations too. That makes him
a thoughtful politician but it also leaves him more vulnerable than an ideologue would be when
confronted by the elite progressive orthodoxies of Tim Walz and CBS News.
Yet Vance had a simple truth on his side that couldn?t be overcome by any amount of narrative spin
or Newspeak. That truth was the record of America?s suffering and humiliation while Kamala Harris
has been in office compared to the peace and flourishing the country enjoyed when Donald Trump
was president. After Walz closed by boasting about Dick Cheney?s support for the Harris campaign
Vance reiterated that Harris shares responsibility for everything that?s happened since 2021 from
inflation to the immigration crisis to the outbreak of new wars in Europe and the Middle East. Dick
Cheney and Joe Biden are a hell of a pedigree for Harris and Walz. Trump won the 2016 election
because Americans were sick of Bushes and Clintons. If they?re sick of the worst of the neocon
right and establishment left they?ll elect Trump again?this time with J.D. Vance as his VP.",The American Conservative_Was_Vance’s_Debate_Victory_Enough.pdf.pdf,news_articles
221,Conservative,The American Conservative,"What a Trump Cabinet Might Look Like
The leaves are falling in Washington?and so is the spell of Kamala Harris?s inevitability.
Whether this is merely the latest gust in the hurricane of shifts that has defined this race since at
least June is any man?s guess. But the conjecture?and very real shadow games?that have framed
the discussions of personnel in a second Donald Trump presidency are beginning to feel like the
prelude to forming a real government.
Advertisement
If history is any guide and it may not be the first thing the president-elect will do will solidify his
transition chair and pick a chief of staff. In 2020 Joe Biden named Ron Klain (a person who once
betrayed the 46th president) chief by November 11 that year. In 2016 Trump and his son-in-law
Jared Kushner wiped out Chris Christie as head of the nascent transition by November 11. On
November 13 2016 Trump named the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus
his chief of staff but installed Steve Bannon in the newly-created role of White House chief
strategist after passing him over for the official role. It was to be an uneasy and unsustainable
power-sharing role between the two men (three if you count Kushner perhaps the real albeit
unofficial chief of staff).
The leading candidates for chief this go-around are probably (in no particular order): Susie Wiles a
seasoned Florida political operator and Trump?s main campaign brain but also potentially a divisive
selection with the grassroots; Kushner (officially this time); Stephen Miller the immigration hardliner
who will thrill the base but revolt the mainstream media; Russ Vought the social conservative
hardliner who would have a similar galvanizing?polarizing effect to Miller?s while drawing attention
to an issue set (social issues) that isn?t particularly Trumpian.But the dark horse may be John McEntee the former personnel director. At 34 he would be the
youngest chief of staff since Dick Cheney in the Ford administration. His selection would thrill true
believers and Trump?s youth wing but criticisms that he is too ?green? and critiques of past
scandals would surface in the media. It?s also entirely possible that Trump erodes the power of the
role??acting? White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Trump?s last chief Mark Meadows
probably won?t get historical treatments a la James Baker.
From there Trump will likely move to the ?great offices of state? to use a British term. But any role
requiring Senate confirmation will be constrained by the terms of a Republican victory. This reality is
likely to be more apparent than following in any election in memory thanks to the unique nature of
Trump?s political phenomenon the zenith of American polarization and a possibly very weird
electoral map. A second Trump cabinet reliant on the final blessing of Maine?s Susan Collins and
Alaska?s Lisa Murkowski is far different than the one that would ensue if say Trump and the GOP
were to sweep the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania.
In the minimum-to-moderate scenario (51-54 Senate seats) the favorite for secretary of state is
Robert C. O?Brien. Trump?s last national security advisor is a pragmatic polished foreign policy
bigwig who has done an assiduous and under-the-radar job of not offending any Trumpian
constituency. And as is a theme with Trump the well-coiffed Brioni-clothed Californian former trial
lawyer is straight out of Hollywood and looks the part.
Advertisement
O?Brien?s principal rival for the role is actually his friend the fellow Californian Ric Grenell formerly
the ambassador to Germany and acting national intelligence director. Grenell would be a flashierpick that would enthuse some stalwart Trump fans but he would probably rely on figures like Kari
Lake his ally to get through the upper chamber. Lake is not favored to win Arizona?s Senate race.
Grenell?s pedigree is mostly hawkish and his selection would be a disappointment to those hoping
for a purer distillation of Trumpian restraint in foreign policy. A third contender for Foggy Bottom is
the Tennessean Senator Bill Hagerty Trump?s former man in Japan. Hagerty has kept a low profile
but is a known commodity in conversations around a potential Trump transition.
A benighted selection would be the former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley the neoconservative
runner-up to Trump in the primaries. But politics in the smartphone age has shown the power of
online insurgencies. As happened to Pennsylvania?s Governor Josh Shapiro?s reported
consideration as Kamala Harris?s running mate this past summer a digital insurgency would
probably emerge against Haley to kill her selection in the crib.
At the Department of Defense Trump may well select the Arkansan Senator Tom Cotton who has
quickly emerged as one of the most effective surrogates for the campaign this cycle. But Trump has
passed on giving Cotton top jobs before and as with Grenell his hawkish bona fides aren?t exactly
stuff that smacks of ?this time will be different.? Hagerty is possible at Defense as well. The
selection of a pragmatist would likely make most sides breathe easier. There would be far worse
things in the world.
A reprise of Mike Pompeo only this time at the Pentagon is possible. But the status of the
relationship between the president and his former top diplomat is not well understood and potentially
poor. Notably this time last year when Virginia?s Governor Glenn Youngkin was weighing a
challenge to Trump in the primary the keynote speaker at Youngkin?s secretive autumn conclave at
the famed Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach was none other than Pompeo. Pompeo has not been
prominent on the trail for Trump. And Pompeo has taken on work for a Ukrainiantelecommunications firm Kyivstar. None of this screams ?major political player? in this current
moment in Republican politics.
The greatest break with business-as-usual at the Pentagon might actually be a continuity pick:
Trump?s last (acting) secretary of defense Chris Miller. The famed former ?horse soldier? was one
of the first men on the ground in Afghanistan and in the dark days of late 2020 and early 2021
helped end America?s doomed crusade there. In a little-noticed longform interview for the Australian
Financial Review this summer Miller flashed his Trumpian id.
?I fully embraced Thomas Friedman?s The World is Flat globalism the whole thing: free trade and
the policies that gutted American industry and left a devastated rust belt.? There was plenty of
reason for Trump to say ?You?ve been played by elites?? Miller said. ?I didn?t think it was that
desperate until I went back to Iowa in 2012.? I do believe in the wisdom of the crowd. There is a
deep deep feeling in America that the old way of doing things is not working.?
Miller diagnosed: ?We fought two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A lot of people believed in the cause
and to lose so dramatically and decisively really made common Americans question the wisdom of
officials and Trump is just channeling that.?
At national security advisor competition for the most important non-Senate confirmed appointment
in government will be teeming.
At the end of the day Trump may well settle on Elbridge Colby. Whatever the men?s differences
Trump is likely to be impressed with his former Defense undersecretary?s Harvard pedigree youth
ambition and CIA connections (his grandfather was director). As with others aesthetics may play a
role. And the selection of J.D. Vance for vice president signals that far from being thenihilist-on-wheels parody of the man Trump is curious about the youth wing intelligentsia that
supports him the so-called ?New Right.? Colby is an eminence grise in these circles. Even a recent
subtle comedown from an ultra-hardline stance on Taiwan signals that the forty-something Colby is
readying for center stage. He is preparing to work for a president who has no real track record of
being a hawk?s hawk on China.
Grenell is possible as NSA as is Keith Kellogg the former deputy NSA. But Trump has passed on
Kellogg multiple times before. And the retired general while tremendously networked has
distinguished himself in recent years as a particularly odd and quixotic Ukraine hawk. Kellogg (a
tight ally with John Bolton?s former chief of staff Fred Fleitz) argues the Biden administration has
failed in Ukraine because it has not supported the Zelensky administration enough.
?Have the United States given Ukraine a support of F-16s? No? Kellogg told Voice of America in
July. ?Did we provide long-range fires early for the Ukrainians to shoot in Russians? No. Did we
provide permission for them to shoot deep into Russia? No. Did the United States provide them the
armored capabilities they needed? We gave 31 tanks. Thirty-one tanks is not even a battalion in the
United States Army.? Kellogg continued: ?You have to give more arms to them because you can?t
trust the Russians. You just have to do it.? (No you don?t ?just have to do it? actually.)
But the true dark horse to head up the National Security Council may be another former deputy
Michael Anton?if he wants the job.
Moving away from national security (officially anyway) Trump will need a steady hand at Treasury
as some in the business class will doubtless drench themselves at the prospect of a second Trump
go. History would imply that the favorite is Howard Lutnick the Cantor Fitzgerald chief who is the
current co-chair of the Trump transition. Like ex-Goldman partner Steve Mnuchin in 2016 thefinancier might have gotten in on the action at just the right moment. In both Democratic and
conventional Republican administrations Treasury is reserved for only the toniest of
players?Goldman chiefs and former Federal Reserve chairs. With Trump it?s the Wild West.
Lutnick has emerged as a persuasive champion of Trump?s tariff policy in recent weeks and he has
a charismatic story. Lutnick lost 658 employees including his brother in the twin towers on
September 11 2001.
Jamie Dimon the eternal JP Morgan head will get some buzz for Treasury but one would think a
failure to endorse Trump this round when so many of his fellow elite have taken the plunge would
finally end this dream. Another possibility is Kushner who has a long career in finance ahead of him
after his father-in-law?s day in the sun. He may want a blue chip credential to add to his
considerable professional portfolio. (And many would be quietly elated to keep him away from
foreign policy.)
A place must be found for Vivek Ramaswamy many will argue?that is if he wants a job and not to
run for Ohio?s governor (and potentially become the DeSantis of the Midwest but with a silver
tongue). The most likely landing spot is the Department of Homeland Security. But the self-made
superstar may think twice about the role. If deportation raids are actually to occur (dubious) the man
behind them could be thanked by history and scapegoated by the present. It?s not exactly prime
real estate for someone who wants to be president.
If Trump does pursue a harder line on immigration (and for perhaps the first time polling indicates
the public outside of Republican ranks is with him) he may install the aforementioned Stephen Miller
at DHS but he will need some comfortable margins in the Senate. A safer perch for Ramaswamy
would be U.N. ambassador a job Joe Biden hilariously declined to give Pete Buttigieg (perhaps to
placate Kamala Harris). Turtle Bay is showtime for any politician who can generate buzz and fromthere it?s an easy entrée to the New York donor set.
Some will also say a place must also be found for Steve Bannon who with excellent dramatic
timing will be released from prison on November 1 nigh on the eve of Election Day. But again
there is a quiet but open question: Does he even want a role? The exact circumstances of
Bannon?s departure from the White House in August 2017 remain shrouded in mystery?probably a
firing but maybe not strictly. Bannon as he does indicated much relief publicly back then.
?I?ve got my hands back on my weapons? he told the Weekly Standard referring to Breitbart
which he later replaced with War Room and a broader arsenal of the Bannonite dark arts. In 2023 it
was revealed ahead of a joint event with the two men at Mar-A-Lago that Bannon and Trump had
not spoken to each other in person in six years.
Finally there is the question of attorney general. Trump has so far found no success from his
perspective at the Department of Justice.
It is plausible Trump goes with a hatchetman especially if the election is a relative landslide. Mike
Davis has emerged as an internet pugilist par excellence provocatively vowing a ?reign of terror? in
a sort-of suicide mission if he were given the job for a short stint. Jeff Clark has emerged as a
movement martyr in recent years and it is of course possible Trump gives him the nod in an act of
elaborate revenge.
But for the decade?s worth of ink spilled about Trump as proto-Mussolini the diagnosis Bannon
gave to NBC in June seems apt: ?Donald Trump is a moderate in the MAGA movement.? Villain
origin stories such as The Apprentice might get movie deals and might be more interesting but
Trump has given more jobs to former Exxon CEOs and Raytheon execs than old cronies from NewYork.
An interesting choice for DoJ would be Ted Cruz.
Cruz was seemingly born to be the nation?s top lawyer and he might be getting tired of being a
target of cosmic significance every Senate election cycle. (He may lose one of these days). And
while he will remain a player in Trump?s Washington in the Senate it?s hard to see how he?s really
?in the mix? the way he was 10 years ago. A leading Cabinet post would change all that. Love or
hate Cruz Trump would add one of the brightest minds in law and politics to his chess set.
The appointment of Cruz would also have a subtle safety switch for Trump. Cruz was Trump?s most
brutal rival in the 2016 primary and though both have tried the relationship has never fully
recovered. Cruz wants the presidency as a wino wants lunchtime Sancerre but it?s unlikely Cruz
will ever really regain his renegade buzz of the mid-2010s unless he gets another starring role. The
Trump show will dominate the box office day and night. Trump also knows Cruz can?t betray him
twice?not if he wants to seek the presidency. And if Cruz emerges as ?Trump?s warrior? he will
cleanse himself of the sins of 2016.

222,Conservative,The American Conservative,"What I Saw in Butler Pennsylvania
On October 5 2024 Donald Trump returned to the Butler Farm Show grounds where he had
avoided death by a hair?s breadth on July 13. He was not the only one to return. From my position
on the left side of the field close to the infamous roof I talked to several attendees who had also
been present on July 13.
One man told me that he was standing more or less where he was that day when the shots rang
out. He had returned to show his support.

Another couple Roger and Linda drove all the way from West Virginia to attend the rally and
showed me on an aerial map where they had been standing when the shots rang out. They
recounted that it had not been immediately clear what was happening and many people had
remained standing until a state trooper near them began to yell for everyone to get down.
Nearly everyone I chatted with stated in some form or another that they were here to show support
for Trump and had already made their minds up to vote for him long ago. As one man who had
driven about an hour to be there put it he was there to show support in the face of the attacks
Trump endures everyday.
Another man I talked to who it serendipitously turned out had been an acquaintance nine years ago
when I had worked in the DC area had driven five hours from Northern Virginia to be here echoed
an experience nearly identical to my own. He had been a ho-hum Trump supporter who was
planning to vote for him but was not enthusiastic until the fateful and tragic events of July 13
transformed his understanding of the election and turned him into a passionate supporter.Numerous local officials and members of the campaign spoke in the four hours leading up to
Trump's appearance around 6pm with nearly everyone emphasizing Corey Comperatore?s life and
his heroic act of shielding his family amidst the oncoming fire. When Christopher Macchio sang
?Ave Maria? as a tribute to Comperatore many people were openly moved to tears.
This was my first time attending a Trump rally or any political rally since I had attended one of Ron
Paul?s in Pittsburgh in 2012. Standing around for seven hours left me plenty of time to reflect on
how I ended up here?not just at the rally but also ?here? in the sense of cheering unabashedly for
Trump. My 23-year-old self from 2016 would have been quite surprised to see me now.
The events of July 13 played a large role. It is difficult to imagine what would have happened to the
country in the event Trump had been killed but there was more to it than just Trump?s brush with
death. The shooting happened a 40-minute drive from my house. A fellow Westsylvanian was killed
and two others one of whom lives in the township next to mine were seriously injured. The shooter
lived about a 20-minute drive away from my house. To say this struck close to home is an
understatement.

For myself and many others the assassination attempt and Trump?s defiant raised fist and call to
?fight fight fight!? represented a cosmological shift in our understanding of the presidential race.
But what exactly was he exhorting people to fight and why did it resonate so deeply with me so asto turn me from a ho-hum unenthusiastic supporter to cheering him on without reservations?
As a naive ?principled nonvoter? libertarian I did not vote in the 2016 election. But by the time
voting day rolled around I found myself rooting for Trump because of the outpouring of vitriol
against Trump supporters who were portrayed as worse than Nazis. Since nearly my entire
extended family supported Trump I took this personally.
It did not matter to many people on social media that the same Pennsylvanian voters who had
propelled Trump to victory had previously been solid Democratic voters. It did not matter that there
were economic and socio-cultural grievances that had motivated this support for Trump. All that
seemed to matter to the voices of rage online was that evil white people had helped to install a
barbarian into the White House.
Aside from taking pleasure in the shock and horror of the people calling my friends neighbors and
family fascist white supremacists I still was highly critical of Trump in the years to come. Yet in the
wake of Trump?s bout with Covid and the obscene death wishes to be seen all over social media I
finally began to understand that the danger of such hatred was not limited to Trump alone but to
those who support him or even just fit the stereotype of supporting him. It was at this point I
concluded that Trump?s opponents were a threat to my family and neighbors and that I would be
voting for Trump. Nevertheless while I was rooting for him I was not particularly enthusiastic
especially in the 2024 campaign season.
I had complaints and quibbles about various policies and plans. I worried who would staff his
administration after the disastrous picks the first time. I was worried about his capricious streak.But Trump?s defiant fist transformed the election from a question of tax rates and foreign policy
minutia to a symbolic clash between incompatible spiritual visions of the nation itself. Before Trump
came on stage Steve Witkoff stated that this election went beyond mere politics to the very soul of
the country. The truth of that statement is especially relevant in Western Pennsylvania not only as
an important region in a state that is likely to be the keystone to the election but as a place that
encapsulates the very heart and soul of America.
Seventy-five miles from where Trump was standing in Butler is the Fort Necessity National
Battlefield in Fayette County. This is where George Washington ignited the French and Indian War
as a result of a land dispute with the French garrison at Fort Duquesne built at the confluence of the
Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers in what is now the heart of downtown Pittsburgh.
Even back then it was clear that geography had destined Western Pennsylvania for greatness. With
abundant coal and other natural resources paired with the numerous waterways that eventually
flowed into the Mississippi River the region experienced extreme growth for over a century helping
to propel Pennsylvania to a peak of 38 electoral votes in the 1912 to 1928 elections second only to
New York?s 45.
Lewis and Clark launched their famous expedition from the renamed Fort Lafayette. The first ever oil
well was drilled in Western Pennsylvania (near aptly named Oil City). Titans of business and
industry like Andrew Carnegie Henry Heinz Andrew Mellon George Westinghouse and Henry Clay
Frick transformed the world with the empires they built here.
The steel mills of the Pittsburgh area produced more steel during the Second World War than all the
Axis powers combined. The Jeep was created in Butler County. Two Pittsburgh companiesAmerican Bridge and the Dravo Corporation employed tens of thousands of people in their Ohio
River shipyards including my late grand-aunt to produce a fifth of all the massive LSTs used in
amphibious landings from Normandy to Saipan.
Western Pennsylvania has been the home of my ancestors since my sixth great-grandfather Paul
Trimmer (also Richard Nixon?s third great-grandfather) died in Washington County in 1838. When
my great-great grandfather Joseph Yost immigrated to America in 1892 he made his home in
Pittsburgh and raised his 11 children five miles from where I live today.
It is precisely this deep and rich history that is ultimately responsible for the untrammeled rage its
inhabitants stir in the minds of the left. A people rooted in the history of specific time and place are
more difficult to treat as simple economic cogs that can be swapped out at will for immigrants from
the rest of the planet. A people rooted in history similarly puts the lie to claim that foreigners can in
fact be even more American than people whose ancestors have lived here for centuries merely
because they have adopted the supposedly universal values of our constitutional system as if
America exists as an abstract exercise in thought.
The disdain with which the establishment holds Western Pennsylvanians was barely hidden in the
past going back to Barack Obama?s remarks in 2008 at a San Francisco fundraiser about people in
?small towns in Pennsylvania? who are ?bitter? and ?cling to guns or religion?. But in the wake of
Trump?s 2016 victory the mask has long since slipped after it became apparent that the people
stuck in history were not planning to go quietly into that good night.In addition to the unceasing vitriol about Trump supporters being Nazis more serious proposals
popped up in places like the New York Times where in October of 2020 Peter Beinart questioned if
the U.S. might need international intervention to deal with Trump and his odious supporters.
Similarly MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted out ?The most humane and reasonable way to deal
with all these people if we survive this is some kind of truth and reconciliation commission???these
people? being Trump supporters who in other words need to be ?dealt with? like Rwandan war
criminals.
?In the end they?re not coming after me. They're coming after you.? Trump?s words in response to
his federal indictment last year ring ever truer the more one pays attention to leftist rhetoric and the
open disdain with which they hold Trump supporters even when they are not openly celebrating
political violence against them.
When Elon Musk spoke at the rally he stated that this may be the last truly democratic election in
the U.S. due to the left importing millions of illegal immigrants into swing states. He later stated in
an interview with Tucker Carlson that if Trump were defeated he would doubtlessly be targeted by
the government even more than he already has been. Tucker remarked that Musk would be
?f*cked?.
So would Westsylvania. But at least someone is fighting for us.","The American Conservative_What_I_Saw_in_Butler,_Pennsylvania.pdf.pdf",news_articles
223,Conservative,The American Conservative,"What?s at Stake in 2024
Since 2016 the Democrats have become to revisit a phrase from the Iraq War decade America?s
war party. Few anticipated this. Barack Obama?s retort to Mitt Romney?s anti-Russian hawkishness
in the 2012 debate (?the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back?) reinforced the
longstanding view that Democrats were oriented more towards peace-making than the GOP. No one
realized it then but Obama?s words marked an end of an era that had begun with Eugene
McCarthy and George McGovern.
Four years later Donald Trump depicted the Iraq war as a big fat mistake and went on to win the
South Carolina primary against rivals who refused to acknowledge the disaster. Eight years after
that Democrats have gone giddy over endorsements for Kamala Harris from former
congresswoman Liz Cheney and her father Dick. The latter was the leading force in the Bush
administration behind the Iraq war and a principal orchestrator of the lies to justify it. He has never
expressed regret over his actions and the horrific carnage that resulted. Bill Kristol who has evolved
from conservative journalism?s most important Iraq war promoter to Never Trumper and Kamala
backer paved the way. Open letters endorsing Kamala from aging GOP foreign policy hawks have
become a critical tool for the campaign to validate her foreign policy seriousness.

It is not clear whether former members of the second Bush administration will secure roles under a
President Harris. But they have reason to hope. Despite the obvious differences in background W.
and Kamala have much in common. Both are good looking and exceptionally photogenic. Neither
developed the slightest reputation for political wisdom or gravitas. For alumni of Bush?s war
disasters seeking a new political vessel Kamala fits the bill more readily than Obama who was
ideologically opposed or Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden with their decades of Washingtonexperience and their own well-developed policy networks. And obviously more readily than Donald
Trump.
As the Kristol circle and the Cheneys have moved to Harris Donald Trump has tried to remake the
GOP into the less warlike of the two parties. It is a work in progress; there are many prominent GOP
hawks who hope to thwart him. But if you look at the Trump campaign now its most visible and
active surrogates are vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance from the beginning the Senate?s most
prominent Ukraine war skeptic and Tulsi Gabbard the former Democratic congresswoman whose
hair began to turn prematurely gray during her first tour as a combat medic in Iraq. Add to them
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. whose trenchant analysis of the Ukraine war and NATO expansion may have
been the position that made him most unacceptable to the Democratic establishment. In September
Kennedy penned an op-ed with Donald Trump Jr. calling for negotiations with Russia. They noted
the announcement of pending changes in Russia?s nuclear doctrine which had previously stressed
that weapons could only be used if the sovereignty of the Russian state was threatened. Kennedy
may be the only prominent American political figure who actually reflects and talks about the Cuban
missile crisis of 1962; his father and uncle of course played a critical role in walking the world back
from Armageddon.
Tulsi and RFK Jr. for Kristol and the Cheneys is a trade most Trump supporters would embrace. The
Democratic establishment seems to welcome it too though one would think there would be
misgivings among Democratic voters beyond the Jill Stein set.
The political turnabout is not merely about a few dozen personalities shifting sides and not merely
about foreign policy. It is still not well understood. The red?blue electoral map of Obama?Romney
2012 is very much like today?s which may lead one to conclude that the cultural battles and
coalitions of that year continue in much the same way intensified by social media. To some extentthey do?Obama?s semi-privately expressed derision for those ?clinging to their guns and religion?
is probably shared by most leading Democrats today.
But the split has evolved and deepened since 2012. If a Democrat had blamed an election loss on
Russian collusion in 2012 rather than 2016 the progressive world would have been more or less
baffled. Now such charges are a predictable part of the Democrat rhetorical arsenal.

The Bush-Cheney administration followed up decisions by President Bill Clinton to push NATO
eastward and in 2008 teed up Ukraine for future membership. There were warnings from inside the
establishment most notably from William Burns then ambassador to Russia and currently CIA
director that extending NATO to Ukraine would be perceived by Russia as an existential threat not
merely by Putin and his circle but by everyone with any connection to the Russian security
establishment. Obama?s joke about Romney?s Russia policy might have signaled that a
progressive American administration would be prudent regarding Russia. However with Hillary
Clinton as secretary of state several neoconservatives including Victoria Nuland were given
important roles guiding his administration?s Russia policy. During Obama?s second term Putin was
transformed in the Beltway mind from a geopolitical rival with a large nuclear arsenal to a visceral
cultural enemy.
In a perceptive essay published in early 2022 on the eve of Russia?s invasion of Ukraine Richard
Hanania suggested that the turning point occurred when Russia became openly culturally
conservative at home at the same time the United States was experiencing the early tremors of its
woke revolution. In 2013 Russia passed legislation outlawing LGBTQ ?propaganda? directed at
minors shortly after it handed down serious jail sentences to members of Pussy Riot theover-the-top feminist performance art collective for sacrilegious acts at the Cathedral of Christ the
Saviour in Moscow. The events transformed Russia?s image among progressive elites. Russia
turned from a recondite subject for foreign policy types to a symbolic participant in the West?s
internal cultural battles though as Hanania noted its urban gay bar scene very much resembled
that of the rest of Europe. Putin?s Russia became not only a threat to Ukraine or the Baltic states
but to all progressive values in the West.
The transformation of Russia from rival to culture war foe was the leading edge in a sea change of
how Democrats view foreign policy. The foreign affairs analyst Christopher Mott has coined the
phrase ?the woke imperium? to describe a new confluence of social justice ideology and
neoconservative foreign policy. For Mott social justice rhetoric thus far has served mostly to
manufacture consent for what the foreign policy establishment would do anyway though its
universalist and culture-transforming rhetoric would justify almost unlimited United States
interventions around the globe. ?The Fight for Ukraine is also a fight for LGBTQ Rights? proclaimed
Vanity Fair in 2022 an early example. In Foreign Affairs still the most establishment of American
journals a trio of authors this summer criticized progressives who were resistant to U.S. military
spending and intervention. ?Today?s progressives need to get comfortable with American power?
they intoned outlining how progressive values required the United States to increase its military
spending.
The issues animating the woke imperium have been gestating for years. The blogger Steve Sailer
began using the phrase ?invade the world invite the world? during the Bush presidency to describe
the mindset of an administration relatively indifferent to policing its own borders but avid to play a
military role in other people?s societies. The growing salience of immigration as a progressive issue
illustrates the degree to which Europe?s political fault lines match our own.Large majorities of Europe?s voters want limited or zero immigration while Europe?s ruling parties
resort to increasingly baroque political and parliamentary maneuvers to keep anti-immigration
parties out of power. Until now an informal alliance of establishment parties supranational EU
institutions and social justice NGOs have collaborated to keep the migrants coming almost at will.
But votes for national populist parties keep rising and a decisive reckoning between the two sides
seems inevitable. Foreign policy including the war in Ukraine has remained a secondary issue for
Europeans but in almost every country those who prefer negotiations with Russia rather than a
Ukraine ?victory? and NATO expansion support a populist left-wing or right-wing
anti-mass-immigration party.
If Russia is the woke imperium?s Great Satan the Little Satan is Hungary led by the repeatedly
elected conservative Viktor Orban. A tiny country it is derided by both progressive and
neoconservative American journalists to a seemingly obsessive degree. Hungary is both the first
European country to actually close its borders to migrants claiming asylum and the NATO member
most openly skeptical about pursuing proxy war with Russia to the point of victory. Other U.S. allies
are genuinely undemocratic and often repressive whether the issue is allowing gay bars or elections
or press freedom but Beltway progressives and neoconservatives who never question American
ties to Morocco or Pakistan or Saudi Arabia become rabid on the subject of Orban.
As in the United States the political battles over immigration and foreign policy have caused major
European figures to retreat from their presumed commitments to centuries-old core Western
liberties. After anti-immigration riots in England and Ireland the past two summers set off by reports
of migrant crime there was at least a temporary wave to suppress and prosecute ?hate speech.? In
the United States no less a liberal establishment figure than Hillary Clinton has openly called for the
prosecution of those who spread what she called ?misinformation? which seemed to be nothing
more than political speech she doesn?t like.In the United States the immigration debate has naturally fused into the general cultural battles over
wokeness. If you want to abolish or radically defund the police of course you want to abolish ICE
and other agencies entrusted to enforce U.S. immigration law. Kamala Harris sought to do that as a
U.S. senator sponsoring a bill to transfer ICE enforcement funds to ?refugee resettlement? NGOs.
She has openly called for the end of deportations which of course is the only meaningful sanction
available to border enforcement agencies. The mainstream press deeply supportive of Harris has
more or less refused to report on these past positions and it is possible her September visit to the
border will allow her to present herself as in line with what voters want.
America?s election is now being contested in seven battleground states. It is roughly tied according
to the polls at this writing though it is possible that Harris or Trump will open up a meaningful lead in
the final weeks. The vast preponderance of American election coverage focuses on issues ancillary
to those central ones discussed here. Abortion regrettably for pro-lifers may be a settled issue for
the current generation of voters. The Biden Harris team has not done terribly with the post-Covid
economy and assuming it continues to bring inflation under control it is not obvious that Trump
would do better.
Much of the November outcome will depend on undecided or marginal voter assessment of
personality and character: Trump is an extraordinary if aging figure who has risen to the top of three
or four different professions. He is also an egotistical man who comes across as an obnoxious
loudmouth to many. Some who might support his positions are simply tired of him. Kamala seems
clearly to be hiding something with her reluctance to speak to the media or off the cuff. With media
assistance she has sought to keep her previous record of woke positions (particularly on
immigration) from voters but it is not clear how much she is also hiding a general lack of knowledge
and competence in addressing a wide range of public policy issues. It is a problem she has beenunable to solve with repetitive incantations of ?I grew up a middle class kid? and other such
phrases.
But the polls now taken most regularly on voter issue concerns?on abortion whom do you trust
more on the economy on ?protecting democracy??don?t get at the more decisive policy differences
between the candidates particularly on foreign policy where presidents have more autonomy to
make historic decisions.
The last time foreign affairs played heavily in American elections was the 1980s. Ronald Reagan?s
famous bear ad in 1984 helped solidify the notion that Democrats might be too naïve or soft to deal
effectively with Moscow. So far as I know no one has tried to estimate whether Harris loses more
?peace? voters to Trump than she gains with Cheney voters. The well-known election analyst Mark
Halperin has suggested that the forever wars may be a kind of sleeper issue favoring Trump though
he stressed that this was more an intuition than an observation based on data.
In a political demography sense it is certain that non-college-educated whites whose shift towards
a Trumpian GOP has been pronounced since the Bush years have paid a steeper price for the
forever wars than any other group in terms of broken families and shattered lives. Military
recruitment unsurprisingly is down and one doubts that calls to fight for the values of the woke
imperium will revive it. But at this moment when the United States active duty military involvement
in the Mideast is more or less veiled and there is heavy technological and training coordination with
Ukraine but no U.S. casualties it is not a foreign policy election. As Walter Kirn and Matt Taibbi
point out taking note of the press?s non-coverage of the menacing changes in Russia?s nuclear
doctrine the pro-Kamala press aims to keep it that way.
It is nonetheless an election with enormous foreign policy consequences. It is not very clear what aKamala foreign policy would look like. Her rhetoric on Ukraine is indistinguishable from people in the
Kristol-Cheney orbit. Would she empower them? Or would she veer nearer to her present national
security advisor Philip Gordon who reputedly has more moderate views and was a player in the
Obama effort to reach a nuclear deal and détente with Iran? Does she agree with Joseph Biden?s
very Silent Generation prudence still evident despite the president?s belligerent Ukraine rhetoric
about the dangers of risking an open conflict with Russia over territories inhabited by
Russian-speaking people on Russia?s border? Or does she believe as she has said not only that
Putin is a Hitler-type tyrant bent on marching his troops into Poland and beyond but also that he is
?bluffing? in his warnings to the West about the dangers of escalating the war as much as the
Beltway establishment now professes? Has she ever thought about such questions?
What is clearer is that Harris as a politician has drawn much inspiration from wokeness which can
be distilled into the notion that the European world and its progeny are more guilty and disreputable
than any other civilization and must uniquely among civilizations be held accountable for its crimes.
She has praised wokeness explicitly without defining it; she has endorsed reparations; she has
argued explicitly that the United States should not have the right to deport people who cross its
borders illegally. This is part of the mentality of the contemporary left. What is new is that these
views are now entirely consistent with a militarized and interventionist foreign policy. Russia no
longer a revolutionary power has become a symbol in our own cultural battles so anti-Russian
sentiment is a key component in America?s own cultural civil war.
The same political fault lines run through every European state as well even if the question of
whether one wants mass Third World immigration is not logically connected to Ukraine?s NATO
aspirations. A Harris victory would be a huge tonic for those parties in Europe who favor
progressivism in all its forms and are anti-Russian hawks?and a damaging setback for those who
think on all of these issues that Hungary might have a point.It would be premature to declare that a Trump victory would signal a triumph for realism and
restraint in American foreign policy. The obvious complicating factor is the Middle East and Israel
under Netanyahu?s leadership is clearly risking wider war most probably in hope of bringing
America into its battles. Trump undoubtedly believes in a version of America First but he is also by
temperament and life experience genuinely sympathetic to Israel. It would be naïve to think those
sensibilities could not come into conflict.
On Ukraine where the risks of wider war including even nuclear war are considerable and
immediate a Trump victory would have more obvious consequences. His second term would serve
almost immediately as precursor to a peace settlement where a free and independent Ukraine
would be shorn of its NATO base aspirations and much of its Russian identifying territories would
remain in Russian hands. There would be peace and rebuilding. Russia?s newly created alliances of
necessity with China and Iran would lose their reason for existence.
Trump has taken an enormous political risk to stake out that ground initially unpopular as was his
Iraq view in his own party. His position is moral and strategically sound. A Trump victory would also
be a tonic for all the forces in Europe stretching ideologically from Giorgia Meloni to Sahra
Wagenknecht who believe that mass Third World immigration is a recipe not only for increased
crime but for endless cultural conflict leading eventually to the fracture and possible erasure of the
never unified but always recognizable cultural entity that was the cradle of modern science and
democracy. In this he stands with the vast majority of Europe?s citizens if not most of the powers
that govern the continent today.

224,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Why Is Harris Obsessed With Iran?
The U.S. Vice President and the Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris showed a
worryingly shallow grasp of the nation?s national security challenges by calling Iran America?s
?greatest adversary? in a Tuesday interview with CBS News?s 60 Minutes. She elaborated that
?Iran has American blood on its hands? and referred to the ?200 ballistic missiles? it fired on Israel.
In a world of a great-power rivalry with the nuclear-armed peer competitors China and Russia to
present a remote Middle Eastern country?hobbled by a plethora of U.S. sanctions highly vulnerable
to alleged acts of sabotage by Israel with literally no allies besides militias in a handful of failed
states?as the main threat to the United States is entirely absurd. Even with its arsenal of ballistic
missiles and drones Iran is no threat to the U.S. which it has no capability and no interest to attack.
Advertisement
Rather the only conceivable threat from Iran to the U.S. comes from the Iranian proxy groups in
Syria and Iraq?it is in those countries where Iran presumably got its hands soaked in that American
blood. The question that she ought to be asking is Why are American troops still in those lands?
With the boiling tensions between Israel and Iran and the nearly unconditional support that the
Biden administration is offering Israel those U.S. soldiers have merely become targets for attacks
by an array of pro-Iranian Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria with no discernible upside for Washington.
Harris?s second argument of why Iran represents a particularly acute threat didn?t have anything to
do with the U.S. interests at all but rather with a country with which the U.S. doesn?t even have a
formal security alliance: Israel. Iran?s attack on Israel is certainly a concerning development from
the point of view of regional security.It has to be viewed in an overall context of mounting tensions the escalation of which Israel
contributed to by lethally attacking the Iranian consulate in Damascus Syria assassinating
Hamas?s political leader in Tehran on the day of the inauguration of the Iranian president Massoud
Pezeshkian and moving the goalposts in Lebanon from ensuring that the Israeli residents of the
regions adjacent to the Lebanese border could return to their homes to seeking a destruction of
Hezbollah a key ally for Tehran. Whatever the rationale behind the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu?s bellicosity Harris never explained how supporting it all the way while risking being
drawn in a war with Iran serves an American interest.
As the Institute for Peace & Diplomacy?s Arta Moeini quipped such ?nonsensical statements are
good for the Iranian ego but they are fantasy at best and fear-mongering at worst?.They show
Harris?s lack of elementary knowledge of international politics not to mention a basic sense of
proportion and common sense?.
Some observers like the Stimson Center?s Emma Ashford see a possible electoral motivation
behind Harris?s fresh hawkishness. Nevertheless Ashford is also skeptical that swinging so hard in
that direction?including boasting endorsements from such war hawks as the former Vice President
Dick Cheney and his daughter the former Rep. Liz Cheney?will attract many voters.

That would be a good occasion for Harris?s Republican opponent Donald Trump to chart a course in
an opposite direction. As the conservative restrainer William Ruger Trump?s nominee for the post
of the ambassador in Afghanistan during his presidency advised Trump should talk about how ?he
isn?t going to send our children our brothers our sisters our fathers and our mothers into more
wars disconnected from our core national interests?.Trump himself occasionally displayed a restrained streak. Nevertheless the Republican party still
by and large views Iran as a bogeyman. Trump while in theory opposed to ?forever wars? just
carelessly advised Israel to bomb Iran?s nuclear infrastructure as a response to Iran?s firing of
missiles on Israel and ?worry about the rest later?. That is highly irresponsible advice as Iran
promised to retaliate further for any Israeli strike. This could lead to an all-out regional war in the
Middle East which Trump would have to deal with should he be elected in November.
In fact during his presidency Trump already tried a ?strike first and think later? approach: when he
ordered the assassination of Iran?s Revolutionary Guards' commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani in
2020. By sheer luck Iranian retaliation did not claim any American lives then and Trump much to
his obvious relief did not have to commit the U.S. to a war with Iran.
Such luck may not accompany U.S. presidents forever. It is therefore incumbent on them whether
Democratic or Republican to avoid needless belligerence towards Iran particularly on behalf of third
countries. Washington and Tehran are unlikely to be friends in the foreseeable future?political
obstacles for that are just too high on both sides?but there is no challenge Iran currently presents
that would require the U.S. to go to war. The first step to recognizing that reality would be to
challenge Harris?s mindless threat-inflation.",The American Conservative_Why_Is_Harris_Obsessed_With_Iran.pdf.pdf,news_articles
225,Conservative,The American Conservative,"Will Speaker Johnson Eat His Words on a December Omnibus?
?We don?t want any buses? House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters in a Tuesday press
conference. ?We?re not going to do any buses OK??
Johnson?s comments came a day before Congress punted on fiscal year 2025 appropriations until
December. But might there be a scenario come December in which an omnibus or minibus is the
best path forward for Republicans?
Advertisement
On Wednesday the House and Senate approved a government funding stopgap measure called a
continuing resolution averting a government shutdown on the eve of the November 5 election.
The Senate led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer seemed content from the start to
circumvent the statutorily mandated appropriations process. Unsurprisingly Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell the lame-duck leader of the Senate GOP once again found common cause with his
Democratic counterpart to spend more of the American people?s money and concentrate power in
congressional leadership.
Johnson meanwhile attempted to get one major concession for conservatives while funding the
government through March. The speaker initially tried to pass a six-month continuing resolution with
the SAVE Act attached which would have protected American elections from illegal immigrant
votes. Voting on that plan was delayed and failed because 14 Republicans joined Democrats in
voting no.
It wasn?t a bad legislative strategy per se. The March deadline would have ensured that Schumerand McConnell could not hogtie Trump via omnibus. The SAVE Act combined Republican voters?
two top priorities?immigration and election integrity.
Johnson made his hand as strong as possible. He created a massive liability for Democrats by
getting them on record voting against protecting the election from illegal migrants. And why Johnson
wasn?t screaming from the rooftops that Democrats refuse to fund the government through March
because they know they deserve to lose the election and that the ?momentum? behind their
hand-picked nominee in Harris is completely fake I?ll never know.
Advertisement
For House Republicans seeking reelection the threat should have been clear: If you vote against
this package you?re telling your constituents you want Trump to lose. It seems Johnson simply
wasn?t aggressive enough to get his plan through.
Now he?s promised no Christmas-time omnibus or minibuses. ?We have broken the Christmas
omni and I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition? Johnson claimed.
But what if that?s the best thing Republicans could do come December?
For Republicans to consider a December omnibus November 5 has to be a disaster:
President-elect Kamala Harris will have a Democratic House and Senate when inaugurated in
January?which frankly is a very real possibility just over a month away from Election Day. In this
case the most influence conservatives will have in the first two years of the incoming Harris
administration would be in the lame duck session of 2024.Sure Johnson would be going back on promises made to his own conference. It wouldn?t be the
first time.
Not long ago Johnson promised the House would not provide supplemental military aid to Ukraine
without real border security. Then Israel was attacked and Republicans in the House demonstrated
through their actions?by passing a supplemental military aid bill for Ukraine and Israel?that the war
in Israel was a higher priority than securing the southern border. I?ve yet to meet a Republican voter
who thinks that Israel funding was a bargaining chip equal to the border.
Johnson should go back on his word again if the political realities change so much that the best way
for Republicans to get a victory is to pass a December omnibus.
Yes the continuing resolution passed Wednesday prolongs the establishment's chosen spending
plan. But whatever Democrats would cook up next conference with Harris at the helm could be a
heck of a lot worse.",The American Conservative_Will_Speaker_Johnson_Eat_His_Words_on_a_December_O.pdf.pdf,news_articles
226,Conservative,The American Conservative,"X Is Becoming a Drag on the GOP
When Elon Musk purchased Twitter in December 2022 conservatives celebrated with unmitigated
jubilation. Twitter which had engaged in systematic censorship and deplatforming arm in arm with
malicious actors in the intelligence community presented a unique and unprecedented threat to
American free speech and expression. Some of those threats particularly the censorship of the New
York Post?s Hunter Biden coverage were potentially election-deciding. For conservatives incensed
by Big Tech?s direct intervention in the American electoral process Musk?s $44 billion Twitter
acquisition felt like a long-overdue and much-needed victory.
It was thrilling to watch Musk follow up on his victory with acts of petty justice. He fired large swaths
of Twitter?s workforce?employees who seemed to harbor personal loathing for the Republican
electorate and their leader President Donald Trump. Musk restored previously banned accounts
including Trump?s and pledged to publish the site?s algorithm which he did in 2023. His moment of
triumph was perhaps best symbolized by the now-infamous ?sink? stunt?his way of telling the world
?Let that sink in.?
Advertisement
Nearly three years later however despite great satisfaction with justice dealt and the restoration of
unfairly censored voices it?s difficult to argue that Elon Musk?s X has enhanced conservative?and
by extension American?discourse. Generally there?s more evidence that conservative discourse
has been fundamentally degraded. While media reports on rising hate speech on X are often
exaggerated or alarmist the reality is that more than ever X is a platform where ?crap is king.?
Musk?s algorithm punishes external links undermining the business models that promote long-form
content creation. This ostensibly reduced clickbait but has turned the platform into a shock-jock
factory rewarding shallow attention-grabbing content that effectively serves as a one-for-onereplacement for clickbait. Influencers are now locked in an arms race for views driven by a
pay-per-view incentive structure that has degraded the quality reliability and depth of
information?especially in the chaotic ?For You? section.
This influencer-driven frenzy has already shaped the 2024 election. The immigration debate once
focused on the southwestern border has shifted to Springfield Ohio where locals claim Haitian
migrants are as Donald Trump put it ?eating the dogs eating the cats.? The pet-eating narrative
which subsequently defined the first presidential debate between Trump and Vice President Harris
was concocted on X. Tucker Carlson whose hit podcast now resides on the platform added to the
GOP?s messaging chaos by hosting a guest who labeled Winston Churchill the ?chief villain? of the
Second World War and questioned the merits of the Allied cause. While provocative this sort of
misstep from a campaign surrogate in the days before early voting began in Pennsylvania was
hardly productive.
As The American Conservative?s own Scott McConnell recently pointed out in an excellent piece
neither presidential campaign has managed to build momentum or secure a sustainable lead in the
polls. He astutely highlights the Trump campaign?s lack of message discipline which has
squandered key moments that should have shifted the race. This seeming inability of the right to
maintain a coherent message?even in the wake of multiple assassination attempts?may partly
reflect Trump?s personality but it increasingly mirrors the influence of X?s content model. Even
Trump?s posts once renowned as 240-character works of comedic brilliance have lost their luster.
They have morphed into multi-paragraph screeds. Brevity even for Donald Trump is the soul of wit.
I could be wrong about the impact this message fragmentation will have on the election; I certainly
hope that I am wrong. It?s possible that a firehose of content can act as some sort of marketing
blitzkrieg and that quantity can truly outstrip quality. But one does worry that Republican messaginghas become a little bit too ?online? when the Arizona GOP places contextless billboards instructing
voters to ?eat less [sic] kittens? right off the swing state?s interstate. Not to mention another
party-funded billboard that features Elon Musk?s photo but not that of Arizona Senate nominee Kari
Lake.
The fact is that most American voters remain?rightfully?squarely in the ?normie? camp. I enjoy
scrolling on X as much as the next politico but the platform is generally incomprehensible or
frightening for most Americans especially older Americans. The issue set promoted and discussed
on the site may percolate out to a wider audience but it?s often received without necessary context
and winds up making the discussing parties appear for lack of a better term weird.
Yes hyper-informed Zoomers will scroll long enough to find out that Springfield Ohio?s city
manager did in fact receive reports of Haitian animal sacrifices. An equally large if not larger
subset of voters will scratch their heads in confusion and wonder if conservatives have lost their
minds. It?s a fundamental disconnect in information diets that has come to define our politics but
ultimately political campaigns are responsible for meeting voters where they are not where they?d
like the voters to be. The legendary GOP consultant Lee Atwater famously remarked that
?perception is reality.? Voters who aren?t scrolling X perceive some degree of weirdness creating a
reality that GOP campaigns across the country are being forced to confront.
At its worst X is beginning to render evidence for some of the sensational accusations levied
against the right in recent years. Anybody who has spent any time on the platform has noticed the
near-ubiquity of generally distasteful content. This includes racist content which seems to be
supercharged by the algorithm preference system for some reason or another. I?m not going to
pearl-clutch about the efficacy of hosting that sort of content but I will note that it?s a turn-off for the
decent-minded people that make up the vast majority of the American electorate. When Elon Muskis so closely associated with the conservative movement the conservative movement is rendered
responsible for the ongoings of his algorithm.
The election looks like it?s going to be another nail-biter and given the last decade?s egregious
polling misses no serious observer can claim to have a wholly accurate read on the race. The
United States is suffering from a deep unyielding malaise. This creates political gravity that might
prevent Vice Kamala President Harris from winning the Oval Office. But regardless of the outcome
it?s likelier than not that X?s pay-per-view model has damaged the coherence of the Republican
Party and its message. If Harris is able to squeak out an unlikely victory X?s influencer rat-race
might be identified as a cause of failure during the electoral post-mortem.",The American Conservative_X_Is_Becoming_a_Drag_on_the_GOP.pdf.pdf,news_articles
227,Conservative,The American Conservative,"?Grand Strategy? Misses the Point
As the United States prepares for the November presidential election political commentators and
security analysts are no doubt also preparing for what now seems like the obligatory ritual of
providing grandiose plans roadmaps blueprints navigational guides frameworks strategy outlines
policy wishlists and designs for the future of American foreign policy. Of course this almost
ritualized behavior is part of the process by which every new U.S. administration begins its four
years in office: by facing numerous calls for the U.S. to adopt a new ?grand strategy.? Having a
grand strategy is seen as the key to defining the future of American ambitions and the means to
securing its national interests. Even before the actual presidential election there have been several
calls for such grand strategies.
Yet the proposed grand strategy revisions are also ?wishful? strategies that overplay the unitary
nature of the state and largely fail to account for the conflicting interests within U.S. politics. The
making of American foreign policy is not led by a clear-sighted president and his strategizing
national security advisor but by a competitive policy marketplace. This ever-expanding marketplace
includes the bureaucracy of planning staffs research institutions and lobbyists who seek not to
secure the national interest but the prestige and funding to expand organizational growth.
Advertisement
The grand strategy commentariat as part of the policy marketplace focuses solely on the idea of
selling a bold blueprint for a new direction in U.S. foreign policy. A grand strategy aims to provide a
?grand vision? or ?design? that can ?lay down a sequence of consecutive steps? by selecting the
resources and means to achieve the best objectives for the state; it is a rational approach to guiding
the ship of state in the name of the ?national interest.? Grand strategy postulates
?decision-makers? responding rationally to external stimuli with a ?clear understanding? of theworld.
While a well-thought-out approach to American foreign policy would be desirable it is at best just an
ideal. Debates over U.S. grand strategy see ?decision-makers? as having unrealistic control over
the apparatus of government and have idealistic notions of the state acting with unitary agency in
support of the ?national interest.? The grand strategy debate abstracts the state from society and
simplifies the ?national interest?; in reality there are multiple competing interests each shaped by
different coalitions and advocacy networks.
Calls to implement a new grand strategy typically take two forms. The first is a progressive or liberal
hegemony approach which valorizes the country?s leadership role in the world and calls for the U.S.
to live up to its supposed exemplary ideals of liberal democracy freedom and human rights. The
second is a more hard-nosed realist approach that calls for prudence restraint and an acceptance
of the tragic nature of power politics. In recent years realists have been particularly tied to the idea
of advocating a grand strategy of offshore balancing in which the U.S. backs away from the failed
interventionist foreign policies of the era of the Global War on Terror. Advocates of offshore
balancing argue that the U.S. can eschew entangling commitments in favor of retreating over the
horizon to act as a power balancer in Eurasia. While such arguments may at times be logical and
persuasive they have consistently failed to influence American policy in practice. Realists then
explain this failure to influence government by pointing to the supremacy of liberal ideology and the
dominance of a liberal elite bureaucracy known as the ?blob.?
The failure of realist voices to influence U.S. policy making is a familiar story within the realist
cannon and was a common theme of the career of the classical realist Hans Morgenthau. Towards
the end of his career Morgenthau was increasingly concerned with dangers to the U.S. body politic.
He looked to The Federalist Papers and the model of Athenian democracy as guides for histheorizing. Unable to influence the American strategy in Vietnam he became concerned with trying
to understand why the U.S. foreign policy establishment would not listen to his realist theories. His
response was to see the corrupting influence of bureaucracies and what he termed ?government by
committee? whereby a ?dual state? was ultimately in control of US foreign policy.
Warnings of a ?dual state? or ?blob? are not ?deep state? conspiracy theories but a recognition of
the reality of a state apparatus which is guided by elites from exclusive backgrounds and career
pathways whereby coalitional networks and advocacy groups can influence and shape U.S. foreign
policy. The mistake of critics who rail against the blob is to believe that it speaks and acts with one
voice. Certainly U.S. foreign policy has been largely dominated since the end of the Cold War by
advocates of primacy who see American hegemony as the cornerstone of international security. But
the possibility of a second Trump term is likely to challenge the foreign-policy dominance of the
primacists. Regardless of whether Trump actually wins the election his America First rhetoric has
strong support and future Republicans may also advocate such policies. The America First
approach has raised alarm bells both domestically and abroad among those who see American
leadership as crucial.
Realists have argued that U.S. grand strategy is resistant to change but a second Trump term may
finally end the dominance of primacists. Trump has vowed to reshape the federal bureaucracy and
?dismantle? the deep state. In some ways this may be a welcome change; American primacy has
certainly not distinguished itself. U.S. policies of primacy have led to the failed wars of Iraq and
Afghanistan and the rise of potential peer challengers in Russia and China. But a foreign-policy
realignment is unlikely to be a smooth transition or to result in the rational adoption of realist policy
prescriptions. The U.S. will face a familiar democratic challenge with a return to factional competition
between different strands of the foreign policy establishment. The recent reemergence of
neoconservative voices from the George W. Bush era certainly shows that some ideas die hard andfactionalism within the foreign policy establishment persists. Whatever comes next is unlikely to be a
carefully coordinated plan following an all-encompassing strategy. The problem of grand strategy
literature is that it depoliticizes the state. It views foreign policy as a seamless top-down process led
by a rational leader who views problems coherently and clearly and can implement a solution
unconstrained by the messiness of politics. Instead the grand strategy of the U.S. should be viewed
as the product of inter-elite competition and a marketplace of ideas that is distorted by interest
groups and advocacy networks. American grand strategy in recent years has been shaped by a
dominance of liberal progressive elites in support of U.S. primacy. But this dominance by liberal
primacists is now open to debate. Realists would do well to revisit The Federalist Papers as
Morgenthau did to understand their concern with corruption the usurpation of powers and crucially
the dangers of factional strife.",The American Conservative_‘Grand_Strategy’_Misses_the_Point.pdf.pdf,news_articles
228,Conservative,The American Conservative,"?Trump-Washing? U.S. History Endangers Our Freedom
Kamala Harris seeks to capture the White House with a message built on vaporous ?positive vibes?
and ?joy.? The Harris campaign is bolstering that message by portraying Donald Trump as a deadly
peril to democracy unprecedented in American history. The former Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) who
hit that theme as hard as anybody during Trump?s administration is back in the news after he
endorsed Harris for the presidency.
Some media coverage is treating Flake?s declaration as another bellwether bailout for Republicans
abandoning Trump. But Flake openly endorsed Joe Biden for President in 2020 and spent the last
three years as Biden?s U.S. ambassador to Turkey.
Advertisement
In fact Flake effectively joined the Democratic Party six years ago when he delivered what was
touted as a ?landmark? speech on the Senate floor on how Trump?s lies endanger democracy. The
exaltation that greeted Flake?s performance settled any doubts about the venality or historical
illiteracy of the U.S. media. Flake became the preeminent exponent of ?Trump-washing? American
history. Because the same myopic approach is permeating media coverage of the 2024 presidential
race Flake?s weaselry deserves reconsideration.
Prior to that January 17 2018 speech Flake received massive publicity after it was leaked that he
would compare Trump to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Flake assailed Trump for calling the media
?the enemy of the people? since Stalin had used the same phrase 80 years earlier against his
enemies. Actually ?enemy of the people? is an ancient phrase?and the title of a famous 1882 play
by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Flake?s jibe is on par with touting a Hitler quote on
motherhood and then accusing any American politician who praised mothers of being a Nazisympathizer.
Flake began his oration by warning that ?without truth... our democracy will not last.? He then
proclaimed that thanks to Trump ?2017 was a year which saw the truth more battered and abused
than any other in the history of our country.?
Had Flake ?just fallen off the turnip truck? as the late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd liked to
say? Flake was correct that Trump flogged facts early and often. But nothing Trump had done
compared to the vast deceptions and idealistic swindles that Woodrow Wilson concocted to drag the
U.S. into the First World War. Similarly Trump?s babble about inauguration crowd sizes was chump
change compared to Lyndon Johnson?s brazen deceits from 1965 to 1968 to justify rendering half a
million American troops to Vietnam.
Flake idealized the pre-Trump era. Flake declared that America?s Founders understood ?that good
faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this
ongoing idea of America? and that without ?shared facts our democracy will not last.?
Advertisement
Sure but what happens if the rulers do not ?share? the facts? The federal government is
classifying?i.e. labeling secret?trillions of pages of documents each year. Since 9/11 the Freedom
of Information Act has become practically a nullity stonewalling citizens and journalists seeking
facts about federal policies. The Bush and Obama administrations vastly increased the use of the
?state secrets? doctrine to cover up torture targeted killing and illegal surveillance. The Obama
administration was also more aggressive than any other presidency in using Espionage Act
prosecutions against journalists for disclosing federal crimes or follies.Flake asserted that ?2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power? and
summoned fellow senators to help ?restore reverence for our institutions.? But reverence is tricky to
reconcile with honesty.
In reality deceit has long been the DC default. Why else would the Pentagon get away with referring
to ?smart bombs? regardless of their perennial killing of women and children not bright enough to
preemptively exit the blast area? The No Child Left Behind program was exalted regardless of how it
swayed many if not most states to lower their academic standards to create an illusion of progress
to satisfy federal mandates. And what about the Obama administration?s arm-twisting to relabel
felons and ex-convicts as merely ?justice-involved individuals??
Counting on a shameless media for applause Flake declared: ?Here in America we do not pay
obeisance to the powerful.? Did Flake ever attend a White House Correspondents dinner where
media attendees grovel shamelessly to anyone who has twice appeared on MSNBC?s Morning
Joe? Groveling is the preferred form of worship in the District of Columbia. Many senators relish the
endless kowtowing they receive each day from parades of lobbyists and donors begging legislative
favors.
If presidential lying was as toxic as Flake claimed democracy would have perished long ago.
History professor Leo Ribuffo observed in 1998 ?Presidents have lied so much to us about foreign
policy that they?ve established almost a common-law right to do so.? From Kennedy lying about the
Bay of Pigs debacle in Cuba to Nixon lying about the secret bombing of Cambodia to Reagan lying
about Iran?Contra entire generations have come of age since the ancient time when candor
constrained presidents.Flake going ?full lofty? asserted that ?from our very beginnings our freedom has been predicated
on truth.? But the Founding Fathers recognized that politicians are conniving rascals?so the
Constitution included a Bill of Rights that severely restricted the government?s prerogative to
trample Americans? freedom and privacy. As Associate Justice Hugo Black declared in the 1971
Pentagon Papers case ?The Government?s power to censor the press was abolished so that the
press would remain forever free to censure the Government.?
Flake warned that Trump?s lies ?have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and
conditioning the public to no longer trust them.? But what if those institutions long since forfeited
trust?
On the day before his speech on lying Flake took a dive on freedom. Five years earlier the former
NSA analyst Edward Snowden revealed how the National Security Agency had carried out ?the
most significant change in the history of American espionage from the targeted surveillance of
individuals to the mass surveillance of entire populations.? Snowden offered a deluge of internal
documents substantiating how NSA was ravaging Americans? rights. But Flake voted to give new
powers to the National Security Agency to conduct warrantless surveillance on Americans. Perhaps
Flake believed that denouncing Trump absolved him from his congressional oath of office to defend
the Constitution.
For Flake like most Washington politicians ?truth? is a flag of convenience. When he first ran for
the House of Representatives Flake pledged to serve only three terms in Congress. In 2005 after
winning his third election to the House he announced that ?it was a mistake to limit my own
terms??and he continued on the congressional gravy train until 2019. Maybe the American people
just got lucky to have Flake in Washington so long? His devotion to truth did not impede him from
signing up with CBS News after he left Congress.Perhaps the starkest gauge of Flake?s character comes from his zealous support for war with Iraq.
In October 2002 when the Bush administration was browbeating Congress for a resolution to give
the president a blank check Flake declared that supporting the resolution for going to war with Iraq
?is our only reasonable option. War will no doubt come at great cost. When we visit the war
memorials we see that cost but the cost of appeasement is far greater.? Supporting the war helped
Flake get re-elected in 2002.
Flake was not merely pro-war: He also exalted George W. Bush. He declared on the House floor ?I
especially commend our President who so forcefully pushed for this resolution and who has so
deliberately pushed for this resolution.? Did Flake repudiate Bush after his administration?s brazen
lies to pave the way to war were exposed? No. Instead Bush was a headliner for at least one major
fundraiser for Flake?s 2018 re-election campaign?an effort he abandoned after he was forced to
recognize how Arizona voters loathed him.
Flake was correct that presidential lying is an evil that deserves to be vigorously exposed and
heartily condemned. Lies subvert democracy by crippling citizens? ability to rein in government.
Citizens are left clueless about perils until it is too late to avert disaster. Unfortunately the more
power the White House possesses the more that it attracts ruthless individuals who do and say
anything to win elections.
Regardless of who wins in November Americans will not have an honest president. Is it too much to
ask Trump?s opponents to stop peddling a fairy tale version of American history? If people believe
that Trump is the only peril on the horizon it will become far easier for Harris or other politicians to
further ravish our rights and liberties. Americans must become far more vigilant about putting
presidents and the federal government back on a leash.",The American Conservative_‘Trump-Washing’_U.S._History_Endangers_Our_Freedom.pdf.pdf,news_articles
0,Liberal,CNN,"An emotional Obama makes his harshest case yet against The Don...
CNN ?
Exactly 16 years ago an impossibly young-looking Barack Obama was barnstorming through Ohio
on a bus tour electrifying huge crowds and emphatically closing the deal on his thumping 2008
election victory.
On another October night on Thursday the 63-year-old ex-president was back on stage with a vast
American flag for a backdrop trying to do for Kamala Harris what she?s so far struggled to do
herself ? put away the 2024 election.
The snowy haired Obama had swapped Ohio which ceased to be a closely contested presidential
state as soon as he left the White House for this year?s potentially decisive state Pennsylvania.
That the hope and change prophet of 2008 is still his party?s most effective political orator four
presidential elections later is an indictment of Democrats. But the urgency of his message in
Pittsburgh told a more immediate story ? his nemesis Donald Trump may be poised for an Oval
Office return.
?We don?t need four more years of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division. America is
ready to turn the page? Obama said. ?We are ready for a better story one that helped us work
together instead of turning against each other. Pennsylvania we?re ready for President Kamala
Harris.?
Sometimes it takes a former president to provide the clarity of argument that a candidate embroiled
in a bitter race can?t make themselves. That happened before ? in 2012 when Bill Clinton took
Obama?s woolly reelection pitch and created a rationale for voters weary of economic pain to sendhim back to the White House.
Obama on Thursday painted a searing picture of Trump as a malicious ridiculous and incompetent
menace while trying to weave a rhetorical case for voters who are feeling economically insecure to
vote for Harris who is part of an incumbent administration nonetheless.
?I am the hopey changey guy so I understand people feeling frustrated feeling we can do better?
Obama said. ?What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake
things up in a way that is good for you Pennsylvania. I don?t understand that.?
Democrats are beginning to worry about Harris? prospects
Obama?s impassioned appeal for Harris in a state that could doom her presidential hopes comes at
a moment when Democrats are fretting that her early momentum after taking over the campaign
from President Joe Biden has ebbed leaving potentially the most critical general election in decades
at best a toss-up with less than a month to go.
?He?s clear-eyed about how close this race is? a source familiar with Obama?s remarks told
CNN?s Kayla Tausche. The ex-president savagely mocked Trump asking whether his successor
had ever changed a tire or a diaper and condemning his single term and ?mean and ugly? border
policies.
Obama?s appearance a full-circle moment since Harris knocked on doors for him in frigid Iowa
before the 2008 caucuses also had a far deeper personal significance. The 44th and 45th
presidents have waged a political feud for more than a decade since Trump built the foundation of
his populist movement on false claims that Obama was not US-born. Birtherism was the earliestindication of the potency of Trump?s political cocktail of racial aspersions and untruths which has
reached new heights in the 2024 election.
More broadly the antagonism between Obama and Trump helps explain the politics of the last 15
years in the United States.
The 44th president heralded a new multi-racial young and socially diverse Democratic coalition as
he built a brand as a leader seeking at least rhetorically to surmount some of the nation?s deepest
divides. Trump fashioned backlash politics in the wake of the nation?s first Black presidency using
racial appeals and a strongman?s zeal for demonizing opponents to create a political movement as
enduring as Obama?s. In many ways the coming election represents a fresh battle between these
two creeds ? and Obama?s legacy including his signature Affordable Care Act may depend on
Harris winning.
Obama slams Trump over false hurricane conspiracy theories
The former president on Thursday accused Trump of violating basic American values. ?Those
didn?t used to be Republican and Democratic values. It used to be we?d have arguments about tax
policy and foreign policy but we didn?t have arguments about whether you should tell the truth or
not? he said.
Video Ad Feedback 'When did that become okay??: Obama calls out Trump's hurricane lies 03:25 -
Source: CNN
He slammed Trump over his false claims that the Biden administration denied hurricane aid to
Republicans. ?You are going to have leaders who try to help and then you have a guy who will justlie about it to score political points and this has consequences? Obama said. ?When did that
become OK??
But the Trump campaign is not letting go of claims that were debunked even by many Republican
state and local officials. ?You?ve got a lot of people who could have been helped a lot of lives that
could have been saved that weren?t and there?s a lot of details to figure out? Sen. JD Vance the
GOP vice presidential nominee said Thursday.
An emerging strategy for Harris in the election endgame
Obama?s remarks were directed especially at traditional Republicans who may abhor Trump?s
conduct and the male voters who form his power base.
Earlier Obama had sought to shore up another traditionally Democratic constituency ? Black men
CNN?s Edward-Isaac Dovere reported. At a Harris campaign office Obama wondered whether the
reticence of some ?brothers? to support the Democratic nominee came down to sexism. ?You?re
thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you
think that?s a sign of strength because that?s what being a man is? Putting women down?? Obama
said. ?That?s not acceptable.?
Yet the former president can only do so much. He?s not on the ballot and for all his undimmed
appeal to Democrats he?s yesterday?s man. And in the past his quintessential appeal has not
always been transferable to other Democrats. He worked hard to elect Hillary Clinton who was
defeated in 2016. One big question now is whether Harris who has been basing her campaign on
generational change and her biography can build on Obama?s critiques of Trump to make her own
sharpened closing argument.People hold signs as former President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign event in support of

The former president?s appearance came after a week in which the Harris campaign has stepped
up its efforts to find and turn out any available voters. The vice president has been far more willing
to enter unscripted situations ? from a ?60 Minutes? interview to an appearance on ABC?s ?The
View? which is popular among women to a trip to Howard Stern?s radio show a favorite of many
American men. On Thursday Harris was seeking to reverse some of Trump?s success among
another traditionally Democratic voting bloc Hispanic voters at a town hall hosted by Univision in
Nevada which she followed with a rally in Arizona.
Democrats are trying to boost their prospects in swing states by clipping Trump?s margins in rural
areas where he runs strongest. The effort will get a boost next week when another former president
Bill Clinton takes to the trail on Harris? behalf recreating the intimate small-scale events that
predated his 1992 presidential campaign. The 42nd president will get the chance to deploy his
southerner?s affinity for connecting with rural voters with relatable economic arguments.
But Democratic concerns about Harris? campaign are palpable. There is no clear leader in CNN?s
average of recent national polls swing state polling shows dead heats and several surveys this
week have suggested that the Democratic nominee?s vital Blue Wall in Michigan Wisconsin and
Pennsylvania could be wobbling.
Harris has also apparently not yet settled on a way to differentiate herself from the Biden
administration?s unpopularity with many voters ? especially those frustrated with high grocery
prices. On ?The View? for instance Harris said ?There is not a thing that comes to mind in termsof? what she would have done differently from the president over the past four years.
But for all the anxiety among Democrats ? rooted in the fear of what Trump would do in a second
term he has promised to devote to ?retribution? ? the race remains impossible to predict as
mid-October approaches. One reason why is that a flurry of massive shocking events ? including
Biden?s withdrawal and two assassination attempts that Trump survived ? did not seem to give
either Democrats or Republicans an advantage in a deeply divided nation. So it?s questionable
whether former presidents or the aftermath of hurricanes will change things at this late date.
Adding to the uncertainty are questions about the exact shape of the likely electorate. Will Trump
succeed in turning out lots of voters who don?t usually engage? Or will the vice president benefit
from a huge showing among female voters enraged by Trump?s role in the overturning of a federal
right to an abortion? Or could Harris? historic potential to become the first Black female president
spike turnout among Black women in swing states like Georgia?
And will Trump?s apparently casual attitude toward a traditional ground game to maximize voter
participation backfire?
Obama stressed on Thursday that there was only one remedy for such intangibles.
?Whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anything in
between do not just sit back and hope for the best? he told the Pittsburgh crowd. ?Get off your
couch and vote. Put down your phone and vote grab your friends and family and vote. Vote for
Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.?",CNN_An_emotional_Obama_makes_his_harshest_case_yet_aga.pdf.pdf,news_articles
1,Liberal,CNN,"Black voters: Harris still lags behind Biden?s 2020 margins but new
CNN poll suggests she has room to grow support
CNN ?
Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by a wide margin among Black likely voters according to a new
CNN poll conducted by SSRS but still falls short of Joe Biden?s winning 2020 margins with this
group. Yet the poll suggests that Black likely voters currently supporting Trump or third-party
candidates are not as locked into their choices as those Black likely voters who back the vice
president.
CNN?s latest poll finds Harris leading Trump by 63 points among Black likely voters 79% to 16%.
That?s a considerable improvement over Biden?s 46-point advantage over Trump among registered
voters in CNN?s June poll which was its last with the president at the top of the ticket. But that
advantage falls short of the Biden-Harris campaign?s 75-point margin among Black voters
according to exit polls from 2020.
Since Harris? entrance into the race enthusiasm among Black voters about the election appears to
have grown. In the latest poll 79% of Black registered voters say they would definitely vote up from
68% in the June poll. For voters overall that stood at 82% in the latest poll about the same as in
June. Black voters now are just as likely as other voters to say it is extremely important that they
personally vote (both at 63%) while in June Black registered voters were less likely to say the
same (57% among Black voters 66% overall).
Harris? improvement over Biden?s margins from earlier this year comes as the poll finds broad
support for her from the 40% of Black likely voters who view Biden?s presidency as a failure ? Harris
leads Trump 65% to 31% among these voters.The poll suggests Trump?s improvements among Black voters relative to 2020 are driven largely by
Black voters under the age of 60. Harris leads among Black voters aged 60 and over by 87 points
almost identical to Biden?s 85-point margin in 2020 according to exit polls for the same group. This
shrinks to a 55-point lead for Harris among Black voters younger than 60 (Biden won this group by
71 points in 2020 according to exit polls). Trump performs best among Black likely voters younger
than 40 with 22% support.

Still CNN?s poll suggests that Harris has the potential to improve her margins. Her supporters are
broadly locked in and unlikely to shift in the race ? 92% of Black likely voters who support Harris say
their minds are already made up. But among those backing other candidates a third say they may
yet change their mind.
Harris is also generally viewed more favorably among Black registered voters compared with
registered voters overall even after accounting for Black voters? overwhelming Democratic lean.
Nearly 8 in 10 Black voters view Harris favorably and Black Democrats view Harris slightly more
positively than others in the party while Black voters outside the Democratic Party offer far more
positive views of her than do independents or Republicans of other races.
Black voters who don?t consider themselves Democrats are more likely than non-Democrats of
other racial backgrounds to say that Harris has improved their view of the Democratic Party; that
they would be proud or excited if she wins the election; and that her views are generally
mainstream with Black Democratic voters offering similar or modestly more positive views thanothers in their party. Among non-Democrats Black voters also rate Harris as more aligned with their
vision of a president than do other voters across all the attributes tested in the poll including
temperament ability to understand the problems of people like themselves and leadership skills.
That carries over to views of Trump too. Non-Democratic Black voters are more likely to view
Trump?s presidency as a failure than other voters who share their partisan perspective and are less
likely to trust Trump over Harris on handling each of the issues tested in the poll including the
economy and immigration.
While Black likely voters are largely focused on the same issues as the broader electorate the CNN
polling does find some differences among Democrats. Black likely voters are just as likely as all
other groups to consider the economy their top issue (41%). Democratic Black likely voters
however are twice as likely as Democratic likely voters overall to consider the economy their top
issue (42% compared with 19%). Democratic Black likely voters are also less apt than Democratic
likely voters overall to say that protecting democracy or abortion and reproductive rights are their top
issue.
When asked which economic issue is most important to them Black voters across the political
spectrum are generally aligned with the overall electorate and put inflation at the top of the list. But
Black likely voters are more likely than other voters to name jobs and wages as the top economic
issue and less likely to say federal spending.
Nearly 9 in 10 Black registered voters say the political system in the United States is in need of a
major overhaul or major reforms and a large majority (85%) say that the federal government does
not do enough for Black Americans. Roughly half of Black voters (47%) say that the federal
government does both too much for White Americans and too little for Black Americans. Still Blackregistered voters are more likely than the broader electorate to say that they are satisfied with the
influence people like themselves have on the political process (52% compared with 38% overall).
The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22 2024 among
2074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all
registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year?s election.
The survey included an oversample of Black registered voters to reach a total of 579; this group has
been weighted to its proper size within the population for all survey results. Results for the full
sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points;
it is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups. Results among Black registered voters
have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 7.8 percentage points; among Black likely voters it
is plus or minus 7.7 percentage points.

2,Liberal,CNN,"CNN Poll: Harris and Trump locked in exceedingly close presidential
race | CNN Politics
CNN ?
The race for president between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is
exceedingly close with Harris? support resting on stronger personal appeal while Trump draws on
a die-hard base and a wide advantage on handling the economy to run about even despite less
positive views of him his empathy and temperament.
Among likely voters nationwide a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds 48% support Harris and
47% Trump a margin that suggests no clear leader in the race. About 2% say they plan to vote for
Libertarian Chase Oliver and 1% for Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Both Harris and Trump hold
positive support from the majority of their backers ? 72% of Trump?s supporters say their choice is
more for him than against Harris while 60% of Harris? supporters say their choice is more for her
than against him.
That?s a major shift in voters? attitudes toward the race compared with earlier this summer. In the
last national CNN poll in July shortly after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for president
and Harris threw her hat into the ring for the Democratic nomination Harris? backers were evenly
divided between affirmative support for her and those driven by anti-Trump sentiment. And Biden?s
supporters in earlier polls said they were largely expressing opposition to Trump with their choice.
The latest poll finds Harris and Trump roughly even with independent likely voters ? Harris at 45% to
Trump at 41% - with a gender gap that is centered among independents. Independent women break
51% Harris to 36% Trump while independent men split 47% for Trump to 40% for Harris with very
little difference between men and women in either party.The gender divide in the poll is also more concentrated among White voters (White men break 58%
Trump to 35% Harris while White women split 50% Trump to 47% Harris) with very little gender
divide among Black or Latino voters. Harris is well ahead among likely voters younger than 30 (55%
support her to 38% who favor Trump) and among Black (79% Harris to 16% Trump) and Latino
(59% Harris to 40% Trump) likely voters.
A scant 2% of likely voters say they haven?t yet chosen a candidate to support and another 12%
have chosen one but say they could change their minds.
The poll suggests that overall Harris has begun to build a more positive public image outpacing
Trump across several measures of how the public views her personally.
Since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee Harris? favorability rating has climbed to its
highest level in CNN polling since just before her and Biden?s inauguration in January 2021
(currently 46% favorable to 48% unfavorable among likely voters) while Trump?s has held steady
(currently 42% favorable to 55% unfavorable among likely voters).
Although many voters are still forming opinions of the major candidates for vice president Harris?
choice for a running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has a notably more positive favorability rating
(36% favorable to 32% unfavorable) than Trump?s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance (30%
favorable to 42% unfavorable).
A narrow majority or more of likely voters nationwide say Harris? temperament (58%) background
and life experience (56%) ability to understand their problems (52%) skills as a leader (51%) and
vision for the country (51%) align with what they want in a president. For Trump by contrast abouthalf of likely voters or fewer say his vision for the country (49%) skills as a leader (49%)
background (46%) ability to empathize with people like them (46%) or temperament (38%) align
with their vision of a president.
But notably in this divided race 51% say each of them has policy positions on major issues that
align with what they want in a president with more saying Trump?s are exactly what they want in a
president (29% for Trump vs. 18% for Harris).
That?s true even as Trump is more broadly seen as ?too extreme? in his views and positions than
Harris is (54% of likely voters say Trump is 42% that Harris is). A small group of those who see
Trump as too extreme are voting for him anyway: He holds the support of 10% of likely voters who
consider his views and policies to be too extreme while Harris has the backing of just 4% of those
likely voters who feel she is too extreme.
Trump also benefits from the 51% of likely voters who say that looking back on his time as
president it was more of a success than a failure. And Harris may be impeded by the widespread
perception of Biden?s time as president as a failure (61% see it that way and only 19% in that
group say they support Harris for president).
Likely voters overall say they trust Trump over Harris to handle the economy (50% Trump to 39%
Harris) immigration (49% Trump to 35% Harris) and foreign policy (47% Trump to 40% Harris).
Even among those who say Trump?s views and policies are too extreme 15% say they trust him
over Harris to handle the economy and the same share say so on immigration.
Likely voters generally favor Harris? approach on abortion and reproductive rights (52% Harris to
31% Trump) uniting the country (43% Harris to 30% Trump) and protecting democracy (47% Harristo 40% Trump).
About 4 in 10 likely voters (41%) call the economy the most important issue for them as they choose
a candidate for president with protecting democracy second at 21% immigration at 12% and
abortion at 11%. Harris? voters are more likely to choose protecting democracy as most important
(37%) over the economy (21%) or abortion (19%) while Trump?s supporters are concentrated on
the economy (61%) and immigration (21%).
Voters who prioritize the economy regardless of whom they support for president are broadly
focused on inflation. A majority (55%) of them say in a follow-up question that inflation is the top
economic issue on their minds as they consider the candidates with only federal spending (12%)
and taxes (11%) joining it in double-digits. Inflation is still a widespread consideration even among
those for whom the economy is not the top issue: 32% in that group say inflation is the biggest
economic issue they?re considering 16% jobs and wages 15% federal spending 13% the cost of
housing and 12% taxes.
Among registered voters 77% say that the recent tone of America?s politics and political debate is
encouraging violence among some people the same as the share who felt that way in September
2019 and 72% in the new poll say the amount of political violence in the US is a major problem.
Registered voters are more inclined to expect political violence to get worse than better regardless
of which candidate is elected this year but more (57%) say it would get worse should Trump be
elected than if Harris were (42%).
Democrats are more apt than Republicans or independents to see the recent tone as encouraging
violence (81% among Democratic registered voters compared with 76% among independents
registered to vote and 73% among Republican registered voters). But partisans on both sides agreeon the severity of the problem (75% of Democratic voters and 73% of Republican voters call it a
major problem; slightly fewer independent voters feel the same way 69%).
Democratic voters are far more likely to say the risk of political violence will get worse should Trump
win (86%) than Republican voters are to say the risk will be higher should Harris win (65%).
Republican voters are also more likely to say things would get worse should their own candidate win
(30%) than Democratic voters are to foresee a higher risk for violence if Harris wins (18%).
Among all registered voters 47% say they would feel ?afraid? if Trump won the election and a
similar 45% would feel that way should Harris win. Forty-one percent would be ?angry? if Trump
won slightly more than those who would feel that way if Harris did (37%).
And there?s a notable shift compared with 2016 among registered voters who say they would feel
more positive emotions if Trump were to win: 41% of voters say they would be excited if Trump won
compared with just 27% who felt that way in June 2016 and 38% say they would be proud up from
24% who said the same eight years ago. The share saying they?d feel embarrassed has dropped
from 56% then to 48% now.
Harris inspires more positive emotions than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did in the summer of
2016. Should Harris win 41% of registered voters say they would feel proud and 40% excited
compared with a respective 35% and 29% who said the same about Clinton then. The share saying
they?d feel embarrassed by a Harris win (41%) is about the same as it was for Clinton (39%).

3,Liberal,CNN,"CNN Poll: Harris leads Trump among young voters but falls short of
Biden?s 2020 winning margin | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris holds a 12-point lead over former President Donald Trump among
voters younger than 35 ? a group that?s largely dissatisfied with the influence it holds in American
politics but remains optimistic about the country?s future according to new CNN polling conducted
by SSRS.
Harris leads Trump 52% to 40% among these likely voters younger than 35. That still suggests a
tighter race among this group than in 2020 when President Joe Biden ended up with a 21-point
margin among the same age group according to exit polls. But it marks a return to more typical
voting patterns after polls earlier in the year showed Biden struggling to rally youth support for a
second term.
The gender gap seen across voters of all ages is present among this group as well. Where female
likely voters younger than 35 prefer Harris over Trump 53% to 39% male likely voters are closely
divided. And among registered voters young women are 15 points likelier than men to express a
positive view of Harris.
Polling on young voters? presidential preference has ranged significantly over the past year. While
most recent polling suggests a return-to-form for young voters favoring the Democratic nominee
following Harris? rise to the top of the ticket these surveys offer varying pictures of the scale of
Harris? advantage with this group. Not every pollster reports the same range of ages in assessing
younger voters? preferences but even in the last few days national polling on the state of the race
has found a margin among younger voters as tight as Harris +3 (in the Quinnipiac University poll oflikely voters age 18 to 34) and as broad as Harris +32 (in the Harvard Institute of Politics poll of
likely voters age 18 to 29).
The latest CNN poll surveyed a larger sample of younger voters than is typical in most national polls
in order to have greater confidence in the results among this critical voting bloc. It suggests a slightly
wider margin for Harris among likely voters under 30 (55% Harris to 38% Trump with that group)
than among those age 18 to 34.
In a race largely ossified by partisanship the CNN poll shows young voters may be among the most
potentially movable part of the electorate: 19% of likely voters younger than 35 say they?re less
than fully set on a choice this election compared with 12% among those 35 and older. There?s also
more uncertainty about which younger voters will cast a ballot at all. Among young registered voters
only about half say that they?re extremely motivated to vote or that they feel it?s extremely
important that they themselves vote both numbers that are significantly lower than among older
groups.
Young Trump supporters are 10 points less likely than young Harris supporters to describe
themselves as extremely motivated and 11 points less likely to place extreme importance on their
own vote a finding that mirrors other recent polling on this age group. There?s also a gender divide
with young female registered voters 13 points likelier than their male counterparts to say they feel
their own vote is extremely important.
Young voters came of age as part of a unique political era. Two-thirds of those younger than 35 said
they first started paying attention to politics during the Obama presidency or later with about
one-sixth saying their memories only date back to Trump?s presidency.Young voters? memory of the Trump presidency are largely sour ? 57% call his presidency a failure
higher than any other age group ? but their feelings toward Biden?s administration are even more
negative with 67% calling it a failure. Still about 3 in 10 young voters who see the Biden presidency
as a failure say they plan to vote for Harris a larger share than she captures among disaffected
voters of all ages. While young White voters are 15 points likelier than older White voters to call
Trump?s presidency a failure that dynamic is reversed among young voters of color who are if
anything slightly more likely than their older counterparts to say Trump?s time in office was
generally a success.
Trump?s favorable rating among young registered voters stands at just 34% while their views of
Harris are on balance roughly neutral ? 47% rate her favorably and 45% unfavorably. About half of
young registered voters 51% say Trump has worsened their view of the GOP more broadly
roughly doubling the 27% who say he improved their views of the party. Young Republican voters
are more likely than older ones to say that Trump improved their perception of the GOP: 66% of
Republican registered voters younger than 35 say so compared with about half among those age 35
or older (51%).
Harris inspires much less negativity for the Democrats but no broader enthusiasm: 35% say she has
had a negative effect on their view of the Democratic Party with 27% saying she?s improved it.
Overall half of registered voters say Trump worsened their view of the Republicans and 40% that
Harris worsened their view of the Democrats.
About 44% of young registered voters describe themselves as belonging to or leaning toward the
Democratic Party with 33% saying they?re Republican or Republican-leaning and 23% that they
don?t lean toward either party. While voters? party affiliations largely remain stable over time there
is some room for movement. Among registered voters overall 38% who are not currently alignedwith the Democratic Party say they?ve at one time considered themselves to be Democrats with
28% who are not currently GOP-aligned saying they?ve previously thought of themselves as
Republicans. Even among younger voters roughly one-third say they once considered themselves
part of a party they?re no longer aligned with.
Likely voters of all ages call the economy their top issue. That?s particularly true among Trump?s
supporters: roughly 6 in 10 Trump supporters call the economy their top issue a number that?s
nearly identical among his younger and older backers. But there?s more of an age divide among
Harris? base. In a contrast to older Harris supporters who call protecting democracy more important
than any other issue in this election younger Harris voters are more focused on abortion and
reproductive rights ? 30% call that their top issue with smaller shares choosing the economy (21%)
or protecting democracy (20%) as their biggest priority.
While likely voters on the whole give Trump a significant edge over Harris on trust to handle the
economy young likely voters are closely split: 43% prefer Trump on the issue while 42% prefer
Harris. Young voters also give Harris a wide advantage over Trump on trust to address abortion and
reproductive rights (57% to 28%) protecting democracy (50% to 33%) and addressing the concerns
of the next generation of Americans (49% to 35%).
About two-thirds of registered voters younger than 35 say they?re dissatisfied with the influence
people like them have on the political process with dissatisfaction particularly high among young
White voters. And the vast majority of young voters 88% say that America?s political system
needs at the least major reforms though only about one-third say it requires a complete overhaul.
Most still express optimism for the future of the US: 58% say that America?s best days are ahead
compared with 42% who say the country?s best days are in the past.Many of those numbers are similar to the voting public as a whole suggesting that young voters
aren?t uniquely disenchanted about the state of the country. Sixty-two percent of registered voters
say they?re dissatisfied with the influence people like them have on the political process 41% say
the country?s best days are now behind it and 36% say that America?s political system needs a
complete overhaul ? a number that?s up 20 points from 2003.
But pessimism about America and a desire for radical change in its governance are more sharply
polarized among older voters. Young Harris voters are 13 points more likely than young Trump
voters to say that the country?s best days lie ahead and 6 points less likely to say the country?s
political system needs a complete overhaul. Among older Harris and Trump voters those partisan
gaps are about twice that size or more.
Most registered voters younger than 35 say the federal government doesn?t do enough to help
people like them (64%) or younger Americans in general (72%) ? in both cases higher than the
shares of voters overall who say the same.And 81% of younger voters say the government doesn?t
do enough for working-class Americans with 72% of under-35 registered voters ? and 64% of voters
overall ? saying the government is doing too much to help the wealthy.
The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone September 19-22 2024 among
2074 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all
registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year?s election.
The survey included an oversample to reach a total of 624 registered voters under the age of 35;
this group has been weighted to its proper size within the population for all survey results. Results
for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0
percentage points; it is the same among likely voters and larger for subgroups. Results among
registered voters younger than 35 have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.6 percentagepoints; among likely voters younger than 35 it is plus or minus 5.4 percentage points.

4,Liberal,CNN,"Daters increasingly seek shared political views. Popular dating apps
are ready to meet the moment
CNN ?
Recognizing that daters are increasingly prioritizing politics in their search for ?the one? many
dating apps have introduced features that make it easier for users to match with potential partners
based on their politics in the run-up to the election.
Tinder last month launched its ?Take Action Center? which introduced profile stickers that allow
users to share whether they will be voting and the issues important to them. The most popular
stickers among the new ones rolled out are ?Hot people vote (I?m voting)? and ?Voting for
reproductive rights.?
Abortion rights are on the ballot in 10 states next month as the issue continues to be a major
political flashpoint.
?We are really committed to protecting reproductive freedom because we believe this really impacts
dating and relationships? said Stephanie Danzi senior vice president of global marketing for Tinder.
?It?s really about making sure (the app?s users) understand what is kind of at stake? she added.
The ?Take Action Center? also features a partnership with Vote.org a nonpartisan voter registration
organization to provide users with election-related information such as polling locations and voter
registration deadlines.
Meanwhile OkCupid has added a dozen new matching questions that focus on voter behavior andhelp show users more compatible profiles. The questions added in January include ?Are you voting
in the 2024 presidential election??; ?What?s the most important issue to you in the 2024
presidential election?? and ?Is it a deal breaker if your date is voting for a different candidate than
you in the 2024 presidential election??
These questions mark a shift in the app?s strategy which previously featured policy-and
candidate-specific questions such as ?Is climate change real?? And following the 2016 election
one of OkCupid?s matching questions was simply ?Trump?? Users could choose ?hell yes?
?yes? ?no? or ?hell no? and nearly 75% of respondents chose the last option.
Michael Kaye the director of brand marketing and communications for OkCupid said the new
direction stems from a change in the way users talk about politics ? from conversations centered
around Joe Biden versus Donald Trump ahead of 2020 to broader discussions ?focused on what?s
happening in the world? ahead of this November.
?We really wanted to be mindful and careful with the questions that we were adding to the app and
not adding any questions that felt like we were splintering people apart further than they already
have? Kaye told CNN.
While registered US voters are split near evenly between the two parties according to Pew
Research Center daters on OkCupid tend to lean more liberal. But 44% of users who chose to
answer a matching question on their political beliefs chose ?other? among the options of ?politically
liberal? ?politically moderate? and ?politically conservative? according to OkCupid?s data.
The app itself has taken progressive stances on political issues and currently has an ?I?m
Pro-Choice? badge which was first introduced in 2021 (OkCupid donated to Planned Parenthoodas part of the launch).
?Our thought process with our matching questions ? is if we?re talking about it with our friends if
we?re talking about it with our family or coworkers most likely people are talking about it on their
dates? Kaye said.
Deal breakers
For Ashley Houghton 29 dating someone who does not have the same political beliefs is ?100% a
deal breaker? and when she was talking to potential partners on dating apps she brought up
politics ?right off the bat.?
?My opening line is ?What do you think about these issues??? said Houghton who lives in
California and works in communications who said a match?s responses tells her whether she wants
to continue the conversation.
These features build on what young daters were already doing to weed out potential partners such
as including ?#BLM? in their dating app profiles in 2020 to indicate their support for the Black Lives
Matter movement noted Lisa Wade an associate professor of sociology at Tulane University whose
research focuses on undergraduate social and sexual life.
Wade added that young daters became more inclined to prioritize shared political values during the
pandemic when vaccines and health mandates became politicized and there were widespread
protests in the wake of George Floyd?s death.
?For those students who wanted to be cautious about Covid for the first time ever they startedasking their potential sexual partners ? who they?re mostly meeting on apps ? about their level of
covid cautiousness ? (which) had been aligned with politics? Wade said. ?They did decide that
even when we?re just talking about a hookup ? that it mattered to them. Politics mattered to them in
a way that it had not before.?
Political polarization in dating represents a microcosm of a larger issue: of people choosing to
?isolate ourselves from disagreeable points of views? and being increasingly able to do so
cautioned Casey Klofstad a professor of political science at University of Miami.
?We are able to tailor our daily lives ? whether it?s media consumption whether it?s the leisure
activities that we engage in and ? the people that we associate with socially or romantically?
Klofstad said. ?The more that we do that I fear that deepens the divide that already exists between
us.?
CNN reached out to Hinge Grindr and the right-leaning dating site Christian Mingle but did not
receive a response.
In a statement Bumble shared the results of its own recent survey which found that 48% of
respondents think ?it is important for them to talk about key social issues while getting to know
someone romantically including voting or social causes they care about to gauge compatibility and
shared values.?
The other side of the dating app aisle
The Right Stuff an app created in 2022 for conservative daters is also hoping to create an
environment catering to shared values.The app co-founded by John McEntee a Project 2025 strategist and former Donald Trump aide
features political prompts such as ?Favorite liberal lie? and ?January 6 was? which allows users to
fill in the blank. But an executive for the app stressed that the app isn?t ?overtly political in nature.?
Raquel Debono the app?s director of marketing and communications argues that on The Right
Stuff ?politics is almost out of the way.?
?Our essential purpose on the app is to connect conservatives and because they?re politically
aligned ? the biggest filter is sort of done for you? Debono said.
The app hasn?t rolled out features specific to the election though Debono said that the team is
considering sending a blast message asking users whether they have registered to vote. It is also
using current political events to court young conservatives on social media particularly TikTok
where it has 3.3 million followers ? more than three times as many as Tinder and OkCupid
combined. The Right Stuff currently has 70000 active users according to the app.
Debono recognizes that political concerns are important to daters especially ahead of a presidential
election.
?Political alignment is increasingly becoming a nonnegotiable factor for many people who are
dating? Debono said. ?I think that an election year just sort of highlights that as Americans have
sort of made political alignment more central to their identities in general and ? just increases the
awareness and visibility of sort of the divide in our country.?
?And not that that?s a good thing or a bad thing? she added ?but it?s the reality we live in.?",CNN_Daters_increasingly_seek_shared_political_views._P.pdf.pdf,news_articles
5,Liberal,CNN,"Democrats sue to block new Georgia rule requiring hand-count of
Election Day ballots | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Democrats sued Georgia?s State Election Board on Monday over a new rule that requires counties
to hand-count the number of ballots cast at polling places on Election Day arguing it will allow ?for
bad-faith actors to claim that fraud has affected election results.?
The new lawsuit escalates an ongoing legal battle between the Democratic Party and Georgia?s
GOP-controlled elections board over a series of controversial rules passed in recent weeks that
critics say will bring post-election ?chaos? into the state.
Backed by Vice President Kamala Harris? campaign the lawsuit argues that the hand-counting rule
conflicts with state law and that the board overstepped its authority when it approved it. Three
Donald Trump allies on the board approved the new rule earlier this month in a 3-2 vote.
?If the Hand Count Rule is allowed to go into effect the general election will not be orderly and
uniform ? large counties will face significant delays in reporting vote counts election officials will
struggle to implement new procedures at the last minute poll workers will not have been trained on
the new Rule because it was adopted too late and the security of the ballots themselves will be put
at risk? lawyers for the Democratic National Committee the Democratic Party of Georgia and
others wrote in the complaint.
Delays caused by the hand-counting they argued would ?introduce opportunities for bad-faith
actors to claim that fraud has affected election results ? a result that would undermine public
confidence in the results and in the election of Democratic candidates specifically.?Before the election board passed the new rules the office of Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr a
Republican warned the board members that the new policies probably violated state law and would
likely be blocked by a judge if anyone filed a lawsuit.
?These proposed rules are not tethered to any statute ? and are therefore likely the precise type of
impermissible legislation that agencies cannot do? Carr?s office told the board saying the new
rules could ?easily be challenged and determined to be invalid.?
The letter from Carr?s team echoed concerns from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger
a Republican who said it was too late to change the rules for the 2024.
A separate lawsuit brought by Democrats against a pair of rules passed by Trump loyalists on the
state election board in August is set to go to trial Tuesday. Those rules require county election
officials to conduct a ?reasonable inquiry? into election results before certifying them and allow them
to ?examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections prior to
certification of results.?",CNN_Democrats_sue_to_block_new_Georgia_rule_requiring_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
6,Liberal,CNN,"Fact check: 12 election lies Trump is using to set the stage to dispute
a potential 2024 defeat
Washington CNN ?
Former President Donald Trump has escalated his long-running assault on the integrity of US
elections as the 2024 presidential campaign enters its final stretch using a new series of lies about
ballots vote-counting and the election process to lay the groundwork to challenge a potential defeat
in November.
Nonpartisan democracy experts say they?re seeing many of the same warning signs that were
blinking red before Election Day four years ago when Trump flooded the zone with election lies and
conspiracy theories that he amplified after losing to Joe Biden. His campaign of deception
culminated in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 2021.
?The threats have not abated; they have only increased? said Lindsay Daniels a senior director at
the nonpartisan Democracy Fund which works to strengthen US democracy. ?We saw a lot of
activity in 2020 around peddling false claims and frivolous lawsuits. We are already seeing signs
now stage-setting that these things may be attempted again.?
Trump has made at least 12 distinct false claims over the last two months that raise baseless doubts
about the validity of a potential victory by Vice President Kamala Harris. (Recent polls suggest the
race is very close and Trump could certainly still win.)
Trump who wrongly insists the 2020 election was marred by massive fraud said at a debate in
June that he will accept the 2024 results regardless of who wins ?if it?s a fair and legal and good
election.? A majority of Trump supporters in battleground states like Michigan Arizona andPennsylvania now say they?re ?not at all confident? or only ?just a little? confident the results will
be accurately tallied according to recent CNN polling.
Trump has lied about the legitimacy of the vote counts in key states the reliability of mail-in and
overseas ballots the size of Harris? crowds at rallies and more. Here?s a fact check of these and
other claims.
False claim: Harris can only win through cheating
For months starting long before any votes were cast in the 2024 general election Trump repeatedly
claimed that he already has enough votes to win and simply needs to ensure Democrats don?t
cheat ? insinuating that the only way he could possibly lose is through fraud.
Trump said at an August rally in Arizona: ?The only way they can do anything is if they cheat like
hell and we?ve been victims of that. ? We don?t need the votes we just want to make sure that
they don?t cheat.? He said at an August rally in North Carolina: ?Our primary focus is not to get out
the vote it?s to make sure they don?t cheat because we have all the votes you need.?
And in a Friday speech in Michigan he said ?If I lose - I?ll tell you what it?s possible. Because they
cheat. That?s the only way we?re gonna lose because they cheat.?
Facts First: This is nonsense. It?s obviously entirely possible that Harris could legitimately win the
presidential election. While it?s also entirely possible that Trump wins legitimately he could not
possibly know for sure at the time of these comments that he already had ?all the votes you need.?
False claim: It was ?unconstitutional? for the Democrats to replace Biden with HarrisTrump has repeatedly claimed the fairness of the 2024 election was tarnished because Biden
dropped out of the race in July and Harris subsequently became the Democratic presidential
nominee. In August he called Harris? ascension ?an unconstitutional coup? and claimed Biden?s
?Presidency was Unconstitutionally STOLEN from him? by Harris.
Facts First: Trump?s claims are false. There was nothing unconstitutional or unlawful about Biden
dropping out and Harris then being chosen by Democratic delegates as the party?s presidential
nominee.
Biden quit the race before he had become the official Democratic nominee ? the party makes the
official nomination at its convention which hadn?t happened yet. That means Biden dropped out
before his name was placed on any state ballots.
CNN spoke in July with election authorities in 48 states and not a single state authority Republican
or Democratic said there were any legal issues with Harris getting on the general election ballot in
place of Biden after she was formally nominated in August. She did not end up facing obstacles
getting on the ballot in any state.
And while Biden certainly faced heavy Democratic pressure to leave the race after his poor
performance in a debate against Trump in June the decision to drop out was his alone; he could
have kept running if he had chosen to do so. In other words the candidate switch was the product of
politics not a forcible takeover.
False claim: Voting by non-citizens is a widespread problem in US electionsTrump and his allies have repeatedly raised concerns that the 2024 election will be tarnished by
widespread voting by non-citizens and undocumented immigrants.
Republicans put this issue front and center in April when Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson
unveiled legislation to require all voters across the country to prove their citizenship. Efforts to pass
the bill fizzled earlier in September amid disunity within the Republican caucus.
Further fanning the flames billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk has championed the conspiracy
theory that Democrats are ?importing voters? so they can create a ?one-party state.? At the
presidential debate earlier this month Trump similarly accused Harris and Democrats of plotting to
tip the election with illegal voters.
?Our elections are bad and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in they?re trying to get them to
vote? Trump said. ?They can?t even speak English. They don?t even know what country they?re in
practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote.?
Facts First: This specific Trump claim is false and it?s also generally untrue to claim that voting by
non-citizens is a widespread problem plaguing US elections. There is simply no evidence to back up
that claim; it?s already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections and the various safeguards
already in place are working effectively to stop it from happening en masse.
Both liberal and conservative think tanks have found only a tiny number of examples of non-citizens
voting in elections where they are ineligible. The right-wing Heritage Foundation?s database of
confirmed fraud cases lists less than 100 examples of non-citizens voting between 2002 and 2022
amid more than one billion lawfully cast ballots.Further nonpartisan experts on election law say such cases are almost always caught thanks to
layers of identity verification built into the registration and voting process.
Here is CNN?s previous fact-check debunking false claims about non-citizens voting widely in
federal elections. And here is CNN?s breakdown of the underlying data in key states showing how
Republicans have massively inflated the size of this problem.
Trump has a long history of blaming electoral losses on undocumented immigrants. When he won
the presidency in 2016 he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million ? and to explain this away he
concocted the lie that ?millions? of non-citizens had voted illegally.
False claim: The US Postal Service admitted it is ?a poorly run mess?
In a social media post in mid-September Trump claimed that the US Postal Service ?admitted that it
is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before? and
asked ?how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024
Presidential Election??
Facts First: Trump?s claim is false. There?s no evidence of the USPS ever admitting that it is a
?poorly run mess.? Reacting to Trump?s comments at a September 19 press conference
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said ?My response is like my response to everyone who says
we?re not prepared for the election ? it is that they?re wrong.?
DeJoy became postmaster general in June 2020 after being selected by the bipartisan USPS Board
of Governors whose members were all appointed by Trump. DeJoy has touted the fact that in 2020
USPS delivered 99% of all mail ballots within one week.The National Association of Secretaries of State an umbrella organization that represents election
officials from both parties started raising alarm bells earlier this month with a sharply worded letter
to DeJoy expressing ?ongoing concerns? about the postal service?s ?ability to deliver election mail
in a timely and accurate manner.?
In response DeJoy said the USPS was undertaking ?extraordinary measures? to make sure all mail
ballots are delivered on time including designated lines at post offices for people with ballots extra
deliveries and collections by letter-carriers ?after-hours? drop-offs to election offices and keeping
processing facilities open longer.
Asked by CNN for proof of the supposed USPS admission that it was a ?poorly run mess? a Trump
campaign spokeswoman responded with two news articles that were not evidence.
The articles were about the recent letter that the election officials sent to DeJoy ? which didn?t
originate from USPS and wasn?t an admission of anything.
Trump has continued raising unfounded doubts about mail-in voting predicting in a recent interview
with a right-wing radio host that USPS ?will lose hundreds of thousands of ballots maybe
purposely.?
There is no evidence of the USPS ever losing ballots on this scale though isolated mishaps have
occurred and been remedied in past election cycles. Furthermore most mail-in ballots are trackable
these days with tracking tools offered in almost every state.
False claim: There is no identity verification for overseas and military votersTrump rolled out a new lie in late September about military and overseas voting.
For this tiny slice of the national electorate voters can receive and submit ballots over email
because they are civilians who live abroad or servicemembers that are stationed overseas.
These are often called ?UOCAVA voters? from the acronym for the federal law that set up this
system: the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act which passed with bipartisan
backing and was signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1986.
The deadline for states to send out UOCAVA ballots was September 21. In a social media post two
days later Trump baselessly accused Democrats of using this program ?to CHEAT? in the election.
?They are going to use UOCAVA to get ballots a program that emails ballots overseas without any
citizenship check or verification of identity whatsoever? Trump claimed.
Facts First: It?s not true that UOCAVA ballots are sent to people with no verification ?whatsoever?
of their identity. These special ballots are only sent to registered voters who request them and
states require people to verify their identity when registering.
David Becker founder and executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation &
Research who regularly advises state and local election officials from both parties blasted Trump
on social media for ?actively spreading false information about a bipartisan program.?
?Military and overseas ballots have gone out to registered verified voters (as required by law) and
they are secure? Becker wrote the day after Trump?s claim. ?I can tell you election officials of both
parties take great pride in giving military and overseas voters a secure voice in our election and it?sunfortunate to see a candidate spread lies about that process.?
Democrats Abroad an arm of the Democratic Party condemned Trump?s ?absurd rant? in a
statement to CNN and said UOCAVA ballots ?are only sent to people whose registration have been
confirmed and validated by their local elections office.?
False claim: Harris spied on Trump?s campaign
Trump launched a new attack on Harris after news broke over the summer that Iranian hackers
breached some Trump campaign email accounts and sent some of the stolen materials to journalists
and Democratic campaign operatives.
?THE FBI CAUGHT IRAN SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN AND GIVING ALL OF THE
INFORMATION TO THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN. THEREFORE SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN
WERE ILLEGALLY SPYING ON ME? Trump posted on Truth Social in mid-September.
Facts First: Trump?s claim that the Harris campaign spied on him is baseless. Iran did breach the
Trump campaign but there?s no evidence anyone from the Harris campaign was involved in the
breach solicited hacked materials or weaponized these materials in any way. The Harris campaign
condemned Iran?s ?unwelcome and unacceptable? election interference.
The federal government announced in August that Iranian hackers successfully targeted the Trump
campaign and that they also attempted to breach the Biden-Harris campaigns.
US intelligence agencies later disclosed that the Iranian hackers sent unsolicited messages
containing some of stolen Trump materials to some people associated with the Biden campaign.This included ?a few individuals? who are currently involved with Harris? campaign her team told
CNN.
Despite Trump?s claims there is no evidence the Iranian hackers provided the Harris campaign with
?all of the information? they stole. The US spy agencies said ?an excerpt? of some stolen material
was provided. More importantly the US spy agencies said ?there is currently no information
indicating those recipients replied? to the hackers.
The Harris campaign?s condemnation of Iran and refusal to use the stolen material is a stark
contrast to how Trump embraced Russia?s hack-and-leak against his Democratic opponent Hillary
Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Even after the US announced that the leaks were part of a
Kremlin plot to interfere with the US election Trump and his campaign built a strategy to capitalize
off Russia?s illegal actions and used the emails to attack Clinton on a near-daily basis.
False claim: California?s vote counts are dishonest
Trump has wrongly claimed for years that US vote counts are plagued by major fraud. In the last
month he has even declared that he would win Democratic-dominated California if there was an
?honest? vote count. (California?s large population means that a candidate?s vote totals there have
a significant influence on the national popular vote ? which Trump has baselessly cast doubt on for
years even when he won the presidency in 2016.)
Trump said in September that ?if I ran with an honest vote counter in California I would win
California but the votes are not counted honestly.? In late August he said ?If Jesus came down
and was the vote counter I would win California okay??Facts First: This is fiction. The votes are counted honestly in California as they are in every other
state. Trump loses California because it is an overwhelmingly Democratic state that no Republican
presidential candidate has carried since 1988.
Trump lost the state in 2020 fair and square by more 5 million votes and more than 29 percentage
points. It?s ridiculous to suggest that fraudulent vote-counting was responsible for a margin that
large.
Like several other states California conducts post-election audits to verify the accuracy of the vote
count. These audits use mathematical models and statistics to access the accuracy of the overall
tally based on random samples of ballots.
False claim: Election officials use early voting to commit fraud
Trump has encouraged his supporters this year to make use of early voting. But at a rally in
Pennsylvania last week he suggested that the lag time between when an early ballot is cast and
Election Day is used by nefarious actors to fraudulently manipulate the count.
?Now we have this stupid stuff where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens
during that 45 ? ?Let?s move the ? see these votes we?ve got about a million votes in there let?s
move them we?re fixing the air conditioner in the room? right? No it?s terrible. What happened the
last time was disgraceful including right here. But we?re not going to let it happen again? Trump
said.
Facts First: This is another phony narrative. There is no indication that there was any counting fraud
involving early ballots in 2020 in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. Early ballots are securely stored inelection offices until they are counted. People who interfere with ballots during this period are
subject to prosecution.
False claim: Trump won Minnesota in 2020
Trump declared in March and May that he won Minnesota in the 2020 election.
At a Minnesota rally in July he claimed ?If they don?t cheat we win this state easily Okay? They
cheat.? He added ?They?re the most crooked. They cheat. They cheated in the last election and
they?re going to cheat in this election but we?re going to get them.?
Facts First: Trump?s claims are false.
He lost Minnesota by more than 7 percentage points in the 2020 election fair and square and he
can certainly lose the state legitimately in 2024.
The state hasn?t chosen a Republican for president since 1972 and Trump has consistently trailed
in opinion polls against Harris ? whose running mate is the sitting Minnesota governor Tim Walz.
False claim: A large percentage of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are fraudulent
Pennsylvania is one of the most important swing states in the 2024 election. Trump claimed in a
social media post in September that an ?election expert? interviewed by right-wing commentator
Tucker Carlson had suggested a large percentage of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania are fraudulent.
?An interview by Tucker Carlson of an election expert indicates that 20% of the Mail-In Ballots inPennsylvania are fraudulent. Here we go again! Where is the U.S. Attorney General and FBI to
INVESTIGATE? Where is the Pennsylvania Republican Party? We will WIN Pennsylvania by a lot
unless the Dems are allowed to CHEAT? he wrote.
Facts First: There is no valid basis for the claim that 20% of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania ? or any
other state ? are fraudulent. This claim appears to be based on a flawed 2023 poll by a right-wing
pollster not the discovery of any actual problems with ballots in Pennsylvania or anywhere else from
2020 2022 or this year.
The 2020 election was fair and secure in Pennsylvania as it was in the rest of the country
according to officials from both parties who affirmed the results. There was a tiny smattering of voter
fraud in the state in 2020 ?? some of it committed by Trump supporters ? but not even close to
enough to have affected the outcome.
Pennsylvania?s Department of State said in a September email to CNN: ?Voting by mail is safe and
secure and no evidence exists of widespread mail voting fraud in Pennsylvania.
Mail ballot fraud has been proven to be exceptionally rare. Claims of systemic voter fraud are devoid
of any supporting evidence and have consistently been rejected by judges government agencies
and election experts across the political spectrum.?
So what was Trump referring to?
Trump and his campaign didn?t specify what interview he was talking about. But in April Carlson
interviewed someone who spoke of a 2023 poll conducted by a right-wing firm Rasmussen Reports
that has itself promoted false election claims. Among likely voters in that poll who said they hadbeen absentee or mail-in voters in 2020 21% claimed to have filled out a ballot for a friend or family
member and 17% claimed they had voted in a state where they were no longer a permanent
resident.
There are lots of reasons not to treat this poll as evidence of mass fraud in Pennsylvania.
First this was a national poll not a Pennsylvania poll. Second the pollster is viewed skeptically by
many polling experts. Third people making claims to a pollster about their past behavior does not
prove that they actually did what they said.
Fourth as FactCheck.org pointed out earlier this month it?s legal to fill out a ballot for a voter with
disabilities who has asked for the assistance ? so someone saying they filled out someone else?s
ballot isn?t necessarily a confession of fraud. Fifth as FactCheck.org also noted the wording of the
residency question was ambiguous enough that people could have thought it was asking about legal
behavior ? such as having voted in 2020 in a different state from the one they currently lived in three
years later.
False claim: Harris fabricated an image to inflate her crowd size
Since 2020 various Trump supporters have claimed that Biden?s unimpressive crowd sizes are
proof that Biden?s 2020 vote total about 81 million was fraudulently inflated. (Trump earned about
74 million votes in 2020.)
In August Trump launched an attack on Harris? crowd sizes. He claimed on social media that Harris
should be disqualified from the race because he claimed she had faked an image of a large crowd
at her rally at a Michigan airport. He wrote: ?There was nobody at the plane and she ?A.I.?d? itand showed a massive ?crowd? of so-called followers BUT THEY DIDN?T EXIST!?
He also wrote ?This is the way the Democrats win Elections by CHEATING - And they?re even
worse at the Ballot Box. She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is
ELECTION INTERFERENCE. Anyone who does that will cheat at ANYTHING!?
Facts First: Trump?s claims are false. Harris did not create a fake image of the Michigan crowd
using artificial intelligence or anything else. As genuine photos and videos showed and reporters on
scene confirmed she had a real crowd of thousands of people at the airport event.
The false claim that the Harris campaign was pushing fake images of this Michigan crowd had been
circulated by some far-right influencers before Trump adopted it.
Asked by CNN in August why he made the false claim Trump said he ?can?t say what was there
who was there? and could only speak about his own large crowds. But he made another false claim
about Harris? crowds at the presidential debate against Harris in September wrongly saying
?People don?t go to her rallies.?
False claim: Biden or Harris orchestrated Trump?s legal cases
Trump has repeatedly claimed this year that ?all? of the legal cases against him including local and
state cases were all orchestrated by Biden for the purpose of ?election interference? to help
Democrats win the election.
In July when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became the Democratic candidate Trump
began claiming she was the one behind the cases.Facts First: These claims are false. There is no evidence that Biden personally orchestrated any of
these cases. Trump never presented any evidence for that claim let alone for suddenly making the
vice president the target of the claim after months of directing it at the president.
There is no sign that either Biden or Harris had any role in bringing charges against Trump in
Manhattan New York (where Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business
records) or Fulton County Georgia (where an election subversion case against Trump is on hold
over a battle about whether the district attorney should be disqualified). Those prosecutions have
been led by elected local prosecutors both Democrats who do not even report to the federal
government.
Trump?s two federal criminal cases one about election subversion and one about Trump?s
retention of classified documents after his presidency were brought by a special counsel Jack
Smith. A judge dismissed the classified documents case in July but Smith is appealing.
Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland a Biden appointee but that is far from
proof that Biden orchestrated the prosecutions ? and certainly not proof that Harris did. Garland has
said he would resign if Biden ever asked him to take action against Trump but expressed
confidence that Biden would never put him in that position.",CNN_Fact_check_12_election_lies_Trump_is_using_to_set_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
7,Liberal,CNN,"Georgia breaking records with early vote...
CNN ?
Two critical battleground states ? Georgia and North Carolina ? are kicking off early in-person voting
this week and the Peach State is already seeing a record number of voters.
Between a flurry of legislative changes and the fallout from Hurricane Helene the experience could
look different for many voters heading to the polls in the coming weeks.
In Georgia voters can head to the ballot box beginning on Tuesday and in North Carolina early
in-person voting begins on Thursday.
Georgia is shattering its record for early voting turnout in the critical swing state on Tuesday
according to state election officials with over 188000 votes cast by 2 p.m. ET. ?We are looking at
blowing by 200000 votes cast in person today. Hats off to our counties and the voters who are
turning out. HUGE!? Gabriel Sterling with Georgia?s Secretary of State office posted on social
media.
Here?s what to know about how voting and elections will work in two key swing states.
Georgia
Fewer drop boxes but more ways to vote early
New state laws after 2020 that tightened rules for absentee ballots and cracked down on the
availability of drop boxes may make the option less appealing than early in-person voting electionexperts said.
While many drop boxes were available 24/7 in 2020 this year there will be fewer of them and they
will be in election offices or early vote locations with hours that tend to mimic normal business hours.
?The drop boxes have really been made so inconvenient to use that fewer voters are able to utilize
them? said Kristin Nabers the Georgia state director for All Voting is Local. ?I don?t want to
discourage people from using drop boxes by any means but I can see why people would think it?s
easier to show up in person.?
Meanwhile the opportunities to vote early in-person have expanded: Georgia law mandates two
Saturdays of early voting and allows for two Sundays of early voting if a county desires.
Limits on feeding people in line
A 2021 law that makes it a crime to offer food or drinks to voters waiting to cast a ballot ? which was
highly publicized by news outlets and immortalized by comedian Larry David in episodes of ?Curb
Your Enthusiasm? ? mostly survived legal challenges. So offering a bottle of water or a snack to
voters within 150 feet of a building where ballots are being cast is still banned.
The law also sought to ban offers of food or beverages within 25 feet of a voter standing in line
even if it was well beyond 150 feet of the building where ballots were being cast. A judge paused
that provision allowing voting rights groups to offer so-called line relief to voters that may find
themselves waiting in particularly long lines.
Hoping to speed up results but worries about uncertaintyThe Peach State made several changes to try to get voters faster election results. At 8 p.m. ET on
election night counties are required to report results from their early in-person and absentee ballots.
As counties tabulate the Election Day vote they?ll provide updates at regular intervals. The goal
according to Georgia?s secretary of state is to provide speedy fair and transparent results.
At the same time several new rules passed by a Donald Trump-backed Republican majority on the
Georgia State Election Board are creating uncertainty around the post-election process. The board
passed a rule requiring a hand count of the number of ballots at each voting location which could
potentially delay the reporting of results.
The board also passed rules allowing county officials to examine extensive election materials prior
to certifying and requiring those officials to conduct a ?reasonable inquiry? before they certify
results.
There are ongoing lawsuits related to all the new rules which Democrats and voting rights activists
worry could be exploited by county-level officials who want to try to challenge election results or
delay the certification process.
North Carolina
Impact of Hurricane Helene damage
Officials in North Carolina have been scrambling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene to ensure
residents are still able to cast a ballot.?I think there will be a drop off it?s hard to really predict how much? Bob Phillips executive director
of Common Cause North Carolina said of the storm?s impact on turnout. ?But I?m encouraged so
far by the response the State Board of Elections has done to educate folks on what to do and how to
vote.?
The North Carolina State Board of Elections website has updates about relocated polling places
how constituents can vote if they lost their identification in the storm and how displaced voters can
request new absentee ballots.
When it comes to early voting sites the 25 western counties most impacted by Helene had planned
for 80 early voting sites. Seventy-five of them will be operational when early voting begins. ?This is
absolutely outstanding that our county boards of elections have pulled this off in western North
Carolina given the devastation and destruction left by Helene? Karen Brinson Bell executive
director for the state Board of Elections said in a briefing last week.
State officials are also still working to secure everything from generators to portable bathrooms to
open as many polling locations as possible on November 5 Brinson Bell said.
No more grace period for mail ballots
Voters considering casting a ballot by mail should note that unlike 2020 their ballots need to be
received by 7:30 p.m. ET on Election Day.
During the last presidential race there was a three-day grace period for ballots to arrive which has
since been eliminated.New voter ID rules
This is the first presidential election where residents of the Tar Heel State will be required to present
identification when they show up to vote. Acceptable forms of ID include a driver?s license passport
and student photo IDs that have been approved by the state election board.
There are exceptions if a voter is unable to provide identification and one of those exceptions is a
natural disaster. In that case voters fill out an ID exception form that accompanies their ballot. The
state election board notes that county election boards are required to count provisional ballots that
include ID exception forms.
Ballot selfies

concerns | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris is planning to visit the US-Mexico border while in Arizona on Friday
according to a source familiar with the discussions as Harris tries to close the gap with former
President Donald Trump on the issue of immigration.
Details of the visit ? which CNN first reported Monday that campaign officials were weighing ? are
still being sorted.
Harris previously visited the border in her capacity as vice president and has cited her work as a US
senator and state attorney general representing a border state ? California.
Immigration has featured prominently in the 2024 presidential election. Democrats grappling with
years of border crises have tried to flip the script on Republicans after the GOP blocked a bipartisan
border measure earlier this year.
Some Harris campaign officials remain concerned about the gap in polling which shows Trump
holding a lead on the issue but also see an opportunity to narrow a gap they believe is closing and
try to shut down GOP attacks over her not visiting the border enough according to one of the
sources.
CNN reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.
Friday?s visit to Arizona also comes at a time when border crossings are the lowest they?ve beensince 2020 ? and comes on the heels of new polling that shows Trump leading in the battleground
state.
US officials have touted back-to-back months of low border crossings citing recent executive action
curbing asylum access at the US southern border even as Trump levies campaign attacks over the
Biden administration?s handling of border security.
Republicans have falsely claimed that Harris is the ?border czar? casting her as solely responsible
for the management of the US-Mexico border. It?s a title that Harris? team has been trying to shake
off since the moment President Joe Biden assigned her to tackle the root causes of migration in
2021.
Harris campaign officials think she has a case on immigration: Using the failed bipartisan border
measure to cast Trump as unserious on the border and citing her time as California attorney general
when she tackled transnational criminal gangs.
Last week Harris slammed Trump over his immigration proposals citing his controversial policies to
draw a stark contrast with her Republican rival.
?While we fight to move our nation forward to a brighter future Donald Trump and his extremist
allies will keep trying to pull us backward. We all remember what they did to tear families apart and
now they have pledged to carry out the largest deportation a mass deportation in American
history? she said.

raids massive detention camps. What are they talking about?? she added.This story and headline have been updated with additional information.",CNN_Harris_campaign_weighs_trip_to_the_US_southern_bor.pdf.pdf,news_articles
9,Liberal,CNN,"Harris heads to the US southern border looking to close a polling
gap with Trump | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris went on the offensive against former President Donald Trump on
immigration Friday during her visit to the southern border in Arizona as she tries to turn a political
vulnerability on its head.
Immigration has featured prominently in the 2024 presidential election with polls showing voters
placing more trust in Trump to handle the issue than Harris.
Democrats grappling with years of border crises have tried to gain ground by pointing to the
bipartisan border measure that congressional Republicans blocked earlier this year after Trump
came out against it. Harris on Friday lambasted Trump for his role in stymying that bill.
?It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border
Patrol union. And it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our
country? she said at a rally in Douglas a town on the US-Mexico border.
?But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and
said ?Stop the bill?? she said. ?He prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the
American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political
games and their personal political future.?
She said she would ask Congress to pass the measure if she is elected and would sign it into law.
She also laid out a series of proposals that she said were ?not just about some rhetoric at a rally?but would help stem the flow of migrants into the United States.
Advisers to the vice president remain concerned about the gap between the candidates on
immigration. But they also cite recent polling showing Trump?s lead on the issue eroding since
Harris took over from President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket ? providing them an
opportunity they say to amplify their message and close the gap further.
Harris outlined plans during her Arizona stop Friday that would make it even harder to lift border
restrictions that have largely barred migrants from seeking asylum in the US.
It?s the clearest example yet of the campaign doubling down on border security by embracing strict
rules that have been condemned by some corners of the Democratic Party. Harris would go a step
further than President Joe Biden?s June executive action by making the threshold for lifting
restrictions harder to reach.
?Solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem and not running on a problem? Harris said.
She said she?d work with Congress to create a pathway to citizenship for ?hardworking immigrants
who have been here for years for years and deserve to have a system that works? as well as
?Dreamers? ? undocumented immigrants brought into the United States as children who are
allowed to live and work in the US under an Obama-era program but generally cannot become
citizens under current law.
?They are American in every way. But still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And
this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades? Harris said. ?The same goes for
farmworkers who ensure that we have food on our tables and sustain our agricultural industry ? andthey too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together and
fix our broken immigration system.?
Earlier this year Biden announced an executive action severely limiting the ability of migrants to
seek asylum at the US southern border if they crossed unlawfully ? a departure from decadeslong
protocol. Immigrant advocates have likened the executive action to Trump-era policies.
The measure can be turned on and off and lifted when there?s a daily average of fewer than 1500
encounters between ports of entry among other criteria. It remains in place.
Homeland Security officials have credited the action for driving down border crossings to the lowest
point since 2020.
Trump alluded to his current polling edge Thursday as he slammed his rival ahead of her visit to the
border.
?Why would she go to the border now playing right into the hand of her opponent?? the former
president told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. ?She keeps talking about how she supposedly
wants to fix the border. We would merely ask: ?Why didn?t she do it four years ago???
Part of the Harris campaign?s strategy to counter Trump includes a new ad titled ?Never Backed
Down? that will run in Arizona and other battleground states highlighting Harris? previous
border-related work and outlining her plans including hiring more border agents.
?She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars and she will secure our border? the
narrator says.A smuggler stands in the background as asylum-seeking migrants from India cross the border wall

An early strategy
The Harris campaign signaled early on that it planned to counter Trump?s attacks on the vice
president and the administration?s handling of border security. Only days after she launched her
presidential bid campaign officials released a video drawing a contrast between Harris and Trump
on immigration policy ? notably leaning on border security.
?Kamala Harris supports increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. Donald Trump blocked a
bill to increase the number of Border Patrol agents? the voiceover in the video stated.
Harris previously visited the border as vice president and has cited her work as a border-state
senator and state attorney general.
Friday?s visit comes at a time when border crossings are the lowest they?ve been since 2020 ? and
follows a recent New York Times/Siena College poll that showed Trump leading in the battleground
state. A Fox News survey of the state that was released on Thursday found no clear leader with
Trump at 50% and Harris at 47% among likely voters.
US officials have touted back-to-back months of low border crossings citing recent executive action
to curb asylum access at the southern border even as Trump has levied attacks over the Biden
administration?s handling of border security.The dramatic recent drop in border crossings has provided a reprieve to the Biden administration
after grappling with record crossings amid unprecedented migration across the Western
hemisphere.
Over that time Republicans have falsely referred to Harris as the ?border czar? casting her as
solely responsible for the management of the US-Mexico border. It?s a title that Harris team has
been trying to shake off since the moment Biden assigned her to tackle the root causes of migration
in 2021.
Harris has only occasionally talked about her assignment which sources said has shown early
success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment. But that?s been bundled
with the administration?s larger migration issues.
Harris campaign officials think she has a case on immigration: using the failed bipartisan border
measure to cast Trump as unserious at the border and citing her record as California attorney
general tackling transnational criminal gangs.
Campaign allies have also stressed the need to look beyond the border and speak to broader
immigration reform pulling from the vice president?s background in the Senate and in California
working on immigrant issues.
?It?s good she?s going. It?s helpful to get her message out there? one source close to the
campaign told CNN. ?Obviously she?s at the border ? that?s the primary focus. But also talking
more broadly about the whole system.?Last week Harris slammed Trump over his immigration proposals citing his contentious policies
including his proposal for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants to paint a dark picture of
her Republican rival.
?While we fight to move our nation forward to a brighter future Donald Trump and his extremist
allies will keep trying to pull us backward. We all remember what they did to tear families apart and
now they have pledged to carry out the largest deportation a mass deportation in American
history? she said at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute leadership conference in
Washington.
?Imagine what that would look like and what that would be. How?s that going to happen? Massive
raids massive detention camps. What are they talking about?? she said.

10,Liberal,CNN,"Harris tries to secure labor support amid signs of weakening | CNN
Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris? struggle to match previous Democratic nominees? levels of support
with union voters is coming under more intense scrutiny following decisions by the Teamsters and
the International Association of Fire Fighters to withhold endorsements in the presidential race.
Leaders from both unions in public statements cited internal disagreements within their
organizations as their primary reason for staying on the sidelines.
?This decision which we took very seriously is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity?
Edward Kelly general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters said in a statement
this week explaining the choice.
The Trump campaign has celebrated these announcements saying they are a sign that organized
labor is fleeing Harris and the Democratic Party. The campaign on Thursday called the firefighters?
union?s decision to decline to endorse a 2024 candidate ?another blow? to Harris pointing to the
union?s early endorsement months ahead of the Democratic primary of Biden
The reality though is murkier ? and reflects the upheaval and increasingly testy internal politics
among the unions? leaders. Harris retains a polling lead over Trump with union voters and
households but the margin according to multiple surveys is smaller than those enjoyed by Joe
Biden four years ago and roughly even with Hillary Clinton?s levels in 2016.
Exit polls from CNN following the past two presidential elections found Biden with a 16-point leadamong voters from union households. Clinton whose loss came down to thousands of votes in
labor-heavy states won by 9 points among the same cohort.
Harris had a 6-point lead over Trump in a Fox News poll conducted in mid-September. A Quinnipiac
poll from later in the month showed Harris with an 11-point advantage similar to a Reuters/Ipsos
survey that found Harris up by 12 points on Trump among voters in union households.
The vice president has been increasingly vocal in her support for labor as the election nears. Her
Friday visit to Michigan comes on the heels of US dockworkers? move to suspend their strike which
could have upset the entire US economy as their union ? which represents an estimated 45000
workers ? moved closer to securing a new contract with ports and shipping companies on the East
and Gulf coasts.
Harris speaks in Flint on October 4 2024. Carolyn Kaster/AP
?This step indicates progress toward a strong contract and represents the power of collective
bargaining? Harris said in a statement late Thursday. ?As I have said this is about fairness ? and
our economy works best when workers share in record profits.?
On Friday in Redford Township just outside of Detroit Harris ripped Trump?s labor record.
?We will not be fooled? Harris said calling the former president and his policies ?a disaster for
working people and he?s trying to gaslight people all over our country.? Harris also described him
as an ?existential threat to America?s labor movement.?
On Wednesday Vance asked by reporters whether former president Donald Trump would continuefunding a $500 million federal grant approved by the Biden administration for GM?s Lansing Grand
River Plant argued that the money was being rerouted to China.
Harris also highlighted Friday $60 million in federal funding to help create an electric vehicle battery
manufacturing plant in Flint which the administration estimates will create 150 jobs.
Despite some headline-grabbing backlash Harris has mostly kept together the coalition of labor
organizations that traditionally back the Democratic nominee. United Auto Workers President Shawn
Fain has emerged as one of her most prominent backers and aggressive advocates frequently
slamming Trump?s labor policies and warning that second Trump administration would be damning
to the movement.
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain speaks at a campaign rally for Harris in Flint on October
4 2024. Carolyn Kaster/AP
Fain who was in Michigan with Harris called the former president and Vance ?two lapdogs for the
billionaire class who only serve themselves? during a fiery convention speech this summer. Trump
he added was a ?scab? ? a traitor to labor unions during times of crisis.
The UAW won big wage and benefit gains after a 2023 strike that received backing from prominent
Democrats some of whom ? led by Biden ? joined workers on the picket lines. Biden the
self-described ?most pro-union president? last September made history by visiting a picket line in
Michigan during the work stoppage.
The AFL-CIO a powerful federation of US and international unions endorsed Harris early on. In a
statement Friday president Liz Shuler cheered a robust jobs report and again made the case for thevice president.
?This election America will decide between Kamala Harris a key partner with unions in creating the
worker-centered economy reflected in today?s jobs report and Donald Trump who would rip all of
the gains we?ve made away? Shuler said touting the organization?s massive ?voter mobilization?
campaign for Harris and Walz.
Other labor leaders have moved slower anxious that siding with either candidate in such an intense
campaign would endanger their own standing.
Both the Democratic and Republican vice presidential nominees Walz and Vance spoke at the
IAFF convention in Boston in late August. Walz?s appeal met with a kinder reception but it was
unclear if union leaders would go all-in for the Democratic ticket or sit out the race.
Vance was booed during parts of his speech particularly after he said he and former President
Donald Trump are ?proud to be the most pro-worker Republican ticket in history.?
That took place about six weeks after Teamsters president Sean O?Brien took the extraordinary
step of speaking at the Republican National Convention in July ? before Biden dropped out. The
move infuriated many labor leaders and puzzled advocates who have repeatedly warned about the
setbacks in store for unions if Trump?s policies come back online.
In his remarks O?Brien noted that Teamsters leaders had previously endorsed Republicans from
Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. The elder President Bush was the last
GOP nominee to win their support. Every Democrat since Bill Clinton who defeated Bush in 1992
has had the Teamsters? official backing.He also took multiple swings at business leaders ? many of whom were in the audience at the RNC
and are among some of Trump?s biggest supporters.
?We are not renters. We are not tenants. But the corporate elite treat us like squatters and that is a
crime? O?Brien said. He did not speak at the Democratic convention and the Teamsters ultimately
decided not to endorse a candidate a month later ? a decision O?Brien attributed to the union?s
?democratic? process and the reality that ?Democrats Republicans and Independents proudly call
our union home and we have a duty to represent and respect every one of them.?
Larry Cohen a former longtime president of the Communications Workers of America downplayed
the Teamsters? decision arguing at the time in mid-September that it was already too late for the
national organization to launch a meaningful election outreach apparatus.
?What are you actually gonna do how in 6 weeks are you going to train people and organize them
(to canvass)? Cohen told CNN. ?They waited too long.?
The Teamsters PAC had previously signaled its political shift earlier in the year when it spent
$5000 to back GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Those moves though triggered a significant
pushback from Teamsters locals in battleground states.
The organization?s Black and West Coast caucuses also struck out on their own endorsing Harris?
campaign which argued that no matter what national leadership said she enjoyed critical support
with the union.",CNN_Harris_tries_to_secure_labor_support_amid_signs_of.pdf.pdf,news_articles
11,Liberal,CNN,"Harris tries to turn the tables on Trump by embracing the border as a
key issue | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris made an aggressive move to cut into Donald Trump?s polling lead on
immigration traveling to the southern border for the first time as the Democratic nominee on Friday
to lay out her plans to tackle what she described as a problem that has languished for decades.
Harris during her trip to the key swing state of Arizona lambasted Trump for his role earlier this
year in tanking a border security bill that was the product of months of bipartisan negotiations.
It was one of Harris? more specific policy speeches since becoming the Democratic nominee
attempting to use her past as California?s attorney general to prove that she has what it takes to
attack Trump on his signature issue.
?It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border
Patrol union. And it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our
country? she said at a rally in Douglas a town on the US-Mexico border.
?But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and
said ?Stop the bill?? she said. ?He prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the
American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political
games and their personal political future.?
The former president responded to Harris? border trip by amping up his own rhetoric on immigration.
Highlighting violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants Trump told a crowd in WalkerMichigan that Harris ?delivered these horrors.?
?She unleashed these atrocities and blood is on her hands at a level that probably nobody?s ever
seen in this country? he said.
Trump also falsely again accused Democrats of letting people enter the country illegally because
?they want the votes.? Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections ? a reality ignored by Trump who
for years has lied about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
The Democratic offensive on immigration and border security is an attempt to cut into one of
Trump?s clearest-cut political advantages. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS released this week
found the former president is trusted by 49% of likely voters to handle immigration while Harris is
trusted by 35%.
Harris on Friday also laid out proposals to strengthen restrictions that have largely barred migrants
from seeking asylum in the United States. And she said she would seek paths to citizenship for
undocumented immigrants brought into the United States as children.
?They are American in every way. But still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And
this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades? Harris said.
2024 race takes a backseat
The battle over immigration and border security comes at a rare moment this late in a presidential
race in which attention has shifted away from both parties? nominees.Dozens of people had been killed as Hurricane Helene swept across the Southeast causing
massive flooding. Meanwhile Israel has escalated its battle with Hezbollah with a strike on a
building in Lebanon that it said was storing missiles.
And both parties? vice presidential nominees are preparing to take center stage next week as
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance meet for their one and only debate Tuesday
night.
Fewer than six weeks from Election Day the 2024 presidential map is still jumbled ? with seven
battleground states coming into focus.
A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS on Friday showed Harris with a comfortable lead for a single
electoral college vote in Nebraska that could have outsized implications.
Nebraska awards one electoral college vote to the winner of each congressional district. The poll of
the Omaha-based 2nd District found Harris leading in the state?s most liberal region with 53%
support to Trump?s 42%.
That single electoral vote could be critical if Harris sweeps the ?blue wall? of Michigan
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but loses the four Sun Belt swing states ? Arizona Georgia Nevada
and North Carolina. That could leave her with 269 electoral college votes ? and one more from
Nebraska could give her the 270 needed to win the White House.
Another CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Friday found the two candidates tied in North
Carolina at 48% each. Trump faces limited paths to victory should he fail to hold North Carolina ?
the state where he earned his slimmest margin of victory in 2020. And the CNN poll found thescandal-plagued Republican nominee for governor Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson far behind his
Democratic rival as the party faces questions about whether Robinson could hurt the overall GOP
ticket there in November.
GOP highlights undocumented immigrants? crime
The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee on Friday held a press call ahead of
Harris? Arizona visit featuring three mothers of those killed by undocumented immigrants or
accidental fentanyl overdose who blamed the vice president for what they described as a lack of
accountability on border security.
?This is not a safe time for Americans. Kamala Harris has not acknowledged my daughter?s death?
said Patty Morin the mother of Rachel Morin who was raped and killed by a 23-year-old citizen of
El Salvador. Rachel Morin was a mother of five herself.
?She is late coming to the table on this. At any point she could do something? said southern
California mother Anne Fundner whose 15-year-old son Weston died from a fentanyl overdose.
The call was an effort to cast doubt on Harris? proposals to tackle border security as Trump argues
that she and President Joe Biden have had four years to do so and have failed.
After a dramatic drop border crossings are currently at the lowest they?ve been since 2020. US
officials have touted back-to-back months of low border crossings citing recent executive action to
curb asylum access at the southern border.
Republicans have labeled Harris the Biden administration?s ?border czar? overstating thepresident?s more limited 2021 assignment for Harris to tackle the root causes of migration in Central
America.
Harris on Friday sought to tap into another part of her resume: Her time as California attorney
general. She highlighted efforts to prosecute members of transnational criminal organizations
including traveling to Mexico City with other attorneys general to share intelligence on gangs and
cartels.
?Stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it
is a long-standing priority of mine? she said. ?I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as
a priority.?

12,Liberal,CNN,"Harris unveils new proposals targeting Black men as she looks to
shore up coalition | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday unveiled new proposals targeting Black men as she seeks
to strengthen her coalition ahead of Election Day.
The announcement comes as Harris lags behind President Joe Biden?s numbers with Black voters
in 2020 especially men though recent polling suggests she has room to grow. Last week former
President Barack Obama delivered a stark warning to Black men saying it?s ?not acceptable? to sit
out this election and suggesting they might be reluctant to vote for Harris because she?s a woman.
The proposal aims to provide Black men ?with the tools to achieve financial freedom lower costs to
better provide for themselves and their families and protect their rights? according to a release by
the campaign.
Part of the proposal includes providing one million loans that are fully forgivable up to $20000 to
Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. According to the campaign the loans would be
provided through a new partnership between the Small Business Administration and some lenders
and banks.
Harris is also calling for creating and investing in programs that help expand pathways for job
opportunities for Black men including promoting apprenticeships strengthening the Public Service
Loan Forgiveness program and investing in more Black male teachers. On the campaign trail Harris
has said she will cut college degree requirements for certain federal jobs if elected president.The plan will also support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets and a
National Health Equity Initiative that focuses on addressing health challenges that disproportionately
impact Black men. Another component includes legalizing recreational marijuana and creating
opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the industry. The vice president has often reiterated
that she believes marijuana should legalized in the US.
The campaign will tout the agenda during several upcoming events including ?Black Men Huddle
Up? events an Economic Freedom Talk series and paid media outreach as they try to draw a
contrast with former President Donald Trump.
?Donald Trump?s outreach is gold sneakers T shirts of mug shots and insults and putting other
communities down. The Vice President is actually speaking to what Black men can achieve under
her presidency. We think that?s a stark point of contrast and one that is important to talk about?
Harris-Walz campaign communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement.
As CNN has reported Harris had been focused on turning out Black men even before she took over
as the Democratic nominee trying to get the enthusiasm there for Biden when he was still running
for reelection.
?The concern is that the couch is going to win? one person close to the Harris team previously told
CNN. ?We need to make sure that Black men Hispanic men don?t sit on the couch. Because if
they don?t vote at all. That?s (a) vote for him.?

13,Liberal,CNN,"Harris weighs more breaks with Biden as he keeps injecting himself
into the campaign
CNN ?
Top aides to Kamala Harris are heading into the final month of the 2024 presidential race still
wrestling with how much distance she can credibly claim from Joe Biden as she looks for more ways
to weave in breaks with him on the campaign trail.
But she keeps getting pulled back to his side for official business at the White House ? and he
keeps injecting himself into the conversation.
Harris aides are looking at rolling out new plans and promises for what Harris would do as president
in part to directly demonstrate notable differences like in her recent more blunt speeches about
abortion rights and tackling the southern border.
?The challenge? of having so little time left in such a short race one adviser to the vice president
told CNN is ?when you?re trying to reach undecided low-intensity voters how do you actually
communicate difference with Biden??
Running as an extension of the president is not a strong position Harris aides know while asserting
what she stands for is.
Neither aides in the Harris campaign nor the Biden White House would commit to another joint
campaign event between now and the election.
Harris wants to create space top aides say but not too much space. She wants to be loyal ? butshe also wants to win. She is still planning to lean on Biden who is flying to Milwaukee on Tuesday
for an event trumpeting more projects made possible by administration efforts to buck up union
members or to park himself in battleground Pennsylvania for political stops in the final weeks. But no
one on the vice president?s team is upset that Biden is headed to spend a whole week of October
overseas on a non-pressing diplomatic trip to Germany and Angola. Some wish he?d go away for
longer.
Part of leading Democrats? focus on Biden is seeing him as the albatross embodiment for the
unsettling feeling spreading among Democrats that the vice president is not ? or at least not yet ?
where she needs to be to win in just over four weeks. Still haunted by the 2016 election they?re
frustrated and despairing that even now seemingly no number of Donald Trump?s offensive
statements lies lack of plans or legal problems can shake his support.
?I?ll go to my grave not understanding why but I know it?s a fact that this is going to be a
margin-of-error race? is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz?s line voicing this sentiment on the trail.
The former president and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance are trying to make Harris out to be
the incumbent talking as if she had been the one signing executive orders for the past three years.
The balance is tricky for a vice president squeezed between battered voters desperate for change;
Republicans responding to her every new proposal by asking why she hasn?t implemented them
already; and an incumbent president whose numbers have been going up with some of the core
constituencies she needs.
Biden?s and Harris? separate appearances surveying Hurricane Helene damage on Wednesday is
like much of what?s to come: ?singing from the same song sheet? as Biden put it on Friday ? but
rarely having them side by side.Even that was a source of tension: Biden?s decision to go to North Carolina earlier in the week
meant that Harris had to hold off on her own trip to a state that she is in an intense fight to win.
No issue for Harris is thornier than the escalating violence in the Middle East ahead of the
anniversary of the October 7 2023 Hamas attacks: With hundreds of thousands of votes on the line
in battleground Michigan alone a range of leaders are pushing her to explicitly distance herself from
Biden people familiar with the discussions tell CNN. But her aides know there can?t be any daylight
when she?s also sitting at his right hand in the Situation Room.
But the economy remains the most frustrating for them with voters still complaining about a
recovery that keeps coming in stronger than almost any expert predicted. Biden wants the credit
while Harris wants to talk about the pain that people are feeling and how much more there is to be
done without being undercut for the suffering on this administration?s watch.
That came to a head in September when Harris responded to the Federal Reserve?s interest rate
cut with a statement about how much more work needs to be done. Then her aides had to spend
hours negotiating with their White House counterparts to scale back a victory lap speech Biden
planned to give the next day according to a person familiar with the matter.
Asked what kind of role she would want Biden to have in the last stretch of Harris? campaign given
how both the situation in Israel and economic frustrations are reverberating through her home state
Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell said ?That?s a complicated question.?
Dingell a longtime booster of Biden who is once again sounding the alarm in her ?blue wall? state
declined to say more.?I am not Joe Biden? vs. ?a major player in everything we?ve done?
Internal Harris campaign research on the September presidential debate found that one of the most
popular moments for the vice president was when she said ?Clearly I am not Joe Biden.?
On Friday after weeks of some junior White House aides complaining to colleagues about having to
run statements and other ideas by the campaign Biden took a different approach.
?She was a major player in everything we?ve done including the passage of legislation which we
were told we could never pass? Biden said. ?She?s been and her staff is interlocked with mine in
terms of all the things we?re doing.?
Aides say Biden?s decision to show up in the White House briefing room for his first time ever as
president was aimed at breaking through to Americans a sense of a good week in holding off more
violence in the Middle East ending the dockworkers? strike and another strong monthly jobs report.
He reveled in laughing dismissively at now-devoted Trump backer Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for
calling the jobs numbers ?fake.?
Biden aides did not coordinate the surprise appearance with Harris? campaign though they did
provide a heads-up minutes before.

White House on October 4 2024. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images
Harris aides did not find the appearance helpful. It was akin to how they felt on Thursday whenBiden edged himself into the news by walking over to reporters so he could praise former Rep. Liz
Cheney?s speech endorsing Harris.
The Trump campaign and other high-profile Republicans meanwhile immediately pounced on how
Biden effectively bigfooted Harris with his briefing room appearance walking out two minutes after
she took the stage at a campaign event in Detroit.
In mid-September the Democratic research and polling initiative Blueprint conducted a national poll
testing a long series of potential statements Harris could make about herself and Biden. Those that
performed best the polling found ?were those that displayed a clear break between her and
Biden? while those that performed worst were ?those that portrayed a future Harris administration
as building on the accomplishments of the Biden era.?
Any mention of Biden the polling found led to less support even if the position it had Harris taking
was the same.
Those numbers have made their way around Harris aides.
?She hasn?t been afraid to say in places where she?s different from him. He?s got no problem with
that? said Mitch Landrieu a former Biden White House infrastructure coordinator who was a
co-chair of Biden?s campaign and now has the same role for Harris. ?They?ve tried to hang Joe
Biden around her negatively but that has not worked because she is not him ? she is clearly
younger than him and she is clearly female.?
Trump as ?the tired old past? with Harris as ?the future?Separating from Trump is much less awkward than separating from Biden and leading Harris
supporters in battleground states told CNN that may be the only real way out of what one called
?the ultimate balancing act.?
?There?s a clear contrast with Trump and as much as that clear contrast can be on display that?s
good. Every day that folks are comparing the chaos of Donald Trump to the views and values of
Kamala Harris is a good day for Kamala Harris? said Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
?Joe Biden has delivered a whole lot for Pennsylvania ? especially when it comes to infrastructure
energy jobs. Remember: Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris a lot more people went to work than
under Donald Trump.?
Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle a longtime close Biden ally who represents a Philadelphia-area
district also urged that kind of focus going forward.
?Every presidential election is about the next four years and not the last four years. Trump has been
ever-present on our TV screens for the last decade and if reelected would be the oldest president
in history. She can credibly say Trump represents the tired old past while she represents the
future? Boyle said. ?She is doing an effective job of claiming the ?candidate of change? mantle.?
Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he was pleased to see how that played out when he joined Harris for
last week?s visit to the US-Mexican border where she met with local officials and delivered a
speech that was different in both setting and taking a hard line than anything Biden has done.

Images?I think it is fair to say that Arizonans want to hear more about this issue but at the same time it
ultimately needs to be about making smart decisions decisions that affect the communities? the
Senate Democrat said. ?I don?t think president and the vice president are going to be exactly the
same on every issue. I think she?s got a smart plan and she?s articulated it well there.?
Harris? talking about her experience as a former border state attorney general with a plan centered
around actually moving forward with a bipartisan law Kelly said is what he thinks works.
So while ?I?m not focused on looking at the comparison between her and the president? Kelly said
?there?s a big difference between her and Donald Trump on the issue.?
Biden wants credit and insists he?s not being precious
For Biden as tends to be the case with him this final stretch is a swirl of politicking and psychology.
The president remains largely at peace with his decision to drop out of the race this summer ? very
aware that if Trump wins his fears for the future of American democracy could be realized and that
his own legacy is on the line as the person who selected and then stepped aside for Harris.
A few weeks ago Biden said that directly to Harris campaign leadership noting that he supports her
doing whatever she needs to do to win a person familiar with the conversation told CNN.
Frustrations continue though. In some corners of the West Wing and beyond Biden allies can?t
help noticing that Trump?s low-intensity schedule; rambling and sometimes stumbling speeches;
and frequently misremembered stories don?t get turned on him as evidence of disqualifyingincompetence as happened to Biden in the spring.
Even into recent days people who have spoken with close Biden advisers told CNN they have
heard complaints that the president would be in the same spot or better right now had he stayed in
the race.
Several leading Democratic operatives and officials laughed out loud when told by CNN about that
sentiment with one veteran consultant saying ?That?s literally insane.?
A Biden senior adviser told CNN that this is by no means the pervasive feeling in the White House.
The president is not prickly or precious about any breaks Harris does make with him the adviser
said arguing that he also keeps saying there?s more work to do.
?The president is all in to help get the vice president elected? the senior adviser said. ?He has and
will continue to travel to battleground states on her behalf to talk about what he?s experienced with
the vice president as a governing partner.?

14,Liberal,CNN,"Harris? border visit and economy speech capture attention as
warning signs emerge for campaign | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Kamala Harris? visit to the border and speech outlining her economic vision captured the attention
of a sizable share of Americans as September came to a close according to new findings from The
Breakthrough a polling project that tracks how the public is following election news. But some
emerging trends in the data hint at warning signs for the vice president?s campaign.
The share of Americans hearing anything at all about Harris has dropped each week since her
presidential debate with former President Donald Trump in early September and during that same
time the tone Americans use in describing what they?ve heard about her has grown more negative
reaching the lowest point of her campaign in the latest results.
Looking at what people say they have heard read or seen about Harris ?lie? has emerged as a
persistent top word that some Americans associate with her. In the latest data it was the
fourth-most mentioned word after ?border? ?polls? and ?campaign.? It ranked sixth in the previous
week?s data and second the week of the ABC News presidential debate after ranking no higher
than 12th in earlier rounds of the survey and no higher than 20th prior to the Democratic convention
in August.
Georgetown University University of Michigan and s3mc.org
The survey conducted September 27-30 by SSRS and Verasight for research teams from CNN
Georgetown University and the University of Michigan measures what Americans say they have
recently heard read or seen about Harris and Trump.The share of Americans mentioning words such as ?lie? or ?liar? when asked what they?ve heard
about Harris remains quite small ? just 6% in the latest data compared with 15% who mentioned
something related to immigration for example ? but it has grown over time rising from 3% or less
prior to the Democratic convention to peak at 9% shortly after the debate.
?Kamala says nothing? wrote one respondent included in the latest survey. ?She uses a bunch of
words that make no sense. She says she will close the border but that is a lie to get elected.
Everything she promises are lies.?
The broader focus on immigration (mentioned by 15% in relation to Harris) and the economy
(mentioned by 13%) in the latest data marks a notable shift in responses about Harris following her
campaign?s efforts to focus attention on the two topics with a visit to the southern border in Arizona
and an economic policy speech in Pittsburgh. It marks the first time in the survey that multiple
policy-related topics have landed in the top five for Harris and the most recent data saw by far the
most mentions for immigration-related words in relation to her campaign since she entered the race
in late July.
?I have watched her speeches and appreciated her articulate explanation of her policies and
positions on various things? another respondent wrote. ?Her concern for all and ability to concretely
point to solutions to problems is a sharp contrast to Donald Trump.?
On Trump?s side the assassination attempts against him remain prominent in the public?s
attention while immigration has faded a bit and his meeting last month with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelensky garnered attention.?He met with Zelensky and was not very enthusiastic about helping Ukraine? one respondent
wrote.
Responses calling the former president a liar are also persistently near the top of his list. About 8%
in the latest data use the word ?lie? or ?liar? in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in
the high single digits as a share of topics about Trump since the start of the survey in June dipping
below that at times including around the first assassination attempt against the former president
and the Republican National Convention.
Georgetown University University of Michigan and s3mc.org
Although responses about Harris are generally still less negative in tone than those about Trump
there has been a notable decline in overall sentiment in the Harris responses while Trump?s
numbers have rebounded slightly following a post-debate drop. For Harris the negative shift is
apparent across parties with sentiments expressed by Democrats Republicans and independents
all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump though sentiment
has held steady among Republicans while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey
among independents and Democrats.
The latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing reading or
hearing something about Harris compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the
fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris
and it?s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they?d heard about each
candidate (Trump down 7 points Harris down 5).
The overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point inprevious cycles though that may be a side effect of debate timing. In 2020 for example more than
8 in 10 Americans reported having heard news about Trump and Joe Biden in the same week of
that campaign but there was a presidential debate held on September 29. In 2016 there was a
mid-September dip in attention ahead of that year?s first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton
held on September 26.
?It has been relatively quiet this week? one respondent to the latest survey wrote when asked
about Trump. ?I haven?t heard of anything.?

15,Liberal,CNN,"Inside the efforts to reach young Black men who might stay home
instead of voting | CNN Politics
Philadelphia CNN ?
Dozens of Black motorcyclists drove through north and west Philadelphia over the weekend with a
simple message for Black men: Go vote.
The ride ? a joint effort between Black Men Vote Black Bikers Vote and other local organizations ?
was one of several nonpartisan events held across the city in a bid to boost registration ahead of a
Monday deadline and drive turnout ahead of Election Day particularly in lower income communities
where turnout tends to lag.
?Hopefully they see us riding they look up and see Black men and women on motorcycles and
they think ?If they can vote maybe I should reconsider it as well?? said Rev. Mark Kelly Tyler of
the Mother Bethel AME Church the head of the biking group. ?People don?t think that Black bikers
talk about voting but when we sit around together and we hang out people are talking about the
election people are talking about issues.?
In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 6-to-1 and campaign signs for the vice
president are sprinkled throughout residential neighborhoods Kamala Harris? challenge isn?t
winning. The question is whether enough of her backers here and in other Democratic strongholds
like Pittsburgh will show up in strong enough numbers to help mitigate former President Donald
Trump?s support in the rural parts of the state.
Younger Black men have received increased attention from the Harris campaign in recent days. Last
week Harris unveiled an agenda for Black men stressing parts of her platform that would specificallybenefit those voters and went on a media blitz that included interviews with the Shade Room and
Charlamagne tha God.
Elected officials and nonpartisan voter engagement groups have also focused in on to young Black
men amid concerns that a significant number will decide to stay home. The efforts have focused on
stressing the importance of voting but also reducing the barriers and misinformation around how to
vote and who is eligible.
Pushing back on apathy and misinformation
Some would-be voters are harder to reach than others.
The Black bikers? ride ended in West Philadelphia?s Container Village an outdoor shopping center
where minority-owned small businesses operate out of refurbished shipping containers.
Tyjuan Harris of Custom Creations a print shop located in the center heard the bikes pull in but
didn?t know they were encouraging voting. While the 42-year-old Philadelphia resident was the
target audience the message likely wouldn?t have resonated.
Tyjuan Harris told CNN he has no interest in following politics. The last time he voted he said was
likely 20 years ago when he cast a ballot for former Vice President Al Gore at the insistence of his
mother. He said he would never make the ?error? of allowing himself to be pressured into voting in
an election he hadn?t researched again.
?I do my own thing I make my own way? Harris said. ?America?s going to be America no matter
who?s in the White House.?Joe Paul the executive director of Black Men Vote said the group frames voting as not just a matter
of civic responsibility but a way to voice their power and shape their communities. But a
combination of mistrust of government and general disillusionment ? combined with structural
hurdles such as voter ID laws and voter roll purges ? remains.
Since January Black Men Vote has been reaching out to its target audience in Michigan Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania where the group says it has registered more than 100000 Black men to vote.
The organization focuses on reaching men where they are ? at basketball courts gyms churches
and through radio and social media advertising. Black Men Vote has also partnered with barbers
who they?ve trained as voting ambassadors to talk to clients about civic engagement.
Paul rejected the notion laid out by former President Barack Obama and others that some Black
men would reject Harris because of her gender or sit out the election.
?I don?t see and we?re not hearing what is being amplified out there that Black men won?t vote for
Kamala Harris because she?s a woman or that Black men will vote for Trump more than they?ll
vote for Kamala Harris or that Black men will choose to vote the couch versus anything else? he
said. ?We?ll see historic turnout among Black men.?
The fight for low propensity voters
Both parties will try to boost their numbers in Philadelphia particularly with low propensity voters. In
2020 Joe Biden won the state by 80000 votes. Ninety-two percent of Black voters in the state
backed the president including 89% of Black men and 94% of Black women according to CNN exit
polls. In Philadelphia which is 40% Black Biden won 81% of the vote.While Trump was able to secure 24000 more votes in Philadelphia in 2020 compared to 2016
Biden improved on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?s margins as well. Overall 66% of
Philadelphia?s 1.1 million registered voters turned out in 2020 the city?s highest voter turnout since
1984.
The Trump campaign believes that among low propensity voters its best bets are voters who skew
younger less White and less engaged with politics than the general electorate a Trump campaign
official told CNN. The campaign boosted by outside groups has sought to tap into some voters?
displeasure with the current economy or direction of the country and tie that to Harris.
And in a change from 2020 the Trump campaign has also guided voters towards options to cast
their ballot beyond voting in-person on Election Day.
?We refer to it as demystifying the process for them? the Trump campaign official said.
?Demystifying where they fit into the electorate and why their voice matters and demystifying how
to actually cast a vote and how easy it is to cast a vote with all of the methods they have available to
them.?
In 2020 Trump said during a debate that ?bad things happen in Philadelphia? after members of the
public were blocked from observing in satellite election offices where voters can register and
request and submit mail ballots ahead of Election Day. Officials blocked the observers because the
spaces were not polling places and the Trump campaign did not yet have approved poll watchers.
The Harris campaign has pointed to its ground game advantages in the city ? including field offices
aimed at reaching voters in predominantly Black neighborhoods like Germantown relationships withsurrogates who have deep ties to their communities and outreach events in churches barber shops
and beauty salons. The campaign hopes to see turnout in the city match the 2020 result.
?We get to the mid 60s the math becomes very difficult for the other side? said a senior advisor to
the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania. ?We can obtain that because we are having conversations in
places in the city that normally don?t have conversation.?
Many voter engagement efforts are focused on reducing the structural hurdles that prevent people
from casting ballots including a lack of information about their voting rights and ways to vote lack of
access to polling places or policies like voter ID laws and voter roll purges.
Philadelphia County which covers the city has also sought to make it easier to vote. Though
Pennsylvania doesn?t have in-person early voting the city designated 11 permanent satellite
election offices. Several voter engagement events including a recent block party headlined by
Philadelphia native DJ Jazzy Jeff have been held outside election offices.
?People believe that they don?t count and my message is pretty simple: It?s a self-empowerment
that you still count that you still have power? said Philadelphia Commissioner Omar Sabir.

16,Liberal,CNN,"Judge pauses rule that would require Georgia counties to hand-count
ballots | CNN Politics
CNN ?
A judge in Georgia has paused a new rule from the Georgia State Election Board that would have
required officials to hand-count the number of ballots cast at each polling place criticizing state
election officials for approving it so close to Election Day.
?No training has been administered (let alone developed) no protocols for handling write-in ballots ?
have been issued and no allowances have been made in any county?s election budget for
additional personnel and other expenses required to implement the Hand Count Rule? Fulton
County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order Tuesday.
?The administrative chaos that will ? not may ? ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of
our boards of elections (and the SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair legal and orderly.?
The new hand-counting rule ? which had been set to take effect October 22 ? would require
counties to count by hand the number of ballots cast at a polling place to make sure it matches the
number of ballots tallied by voting machines. The hand-counters however wouldn?t be tallying how
many votes each candidate received as that?s what the machines do.
Democrats cheered the ruling Tuesday evening. ?From the beginning this rule was an effort to
delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome and our democracy is stronger thanks to this
decision to block it. We will continue fighting to ensure that voters can cast their ballot knowing it will
count? the Harris campaign Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia said
in a joint statement.The hand-count rule is the subject of litigation on multiple fronts and a separate hearing on the
matter is set for Wednesday. Passed by the Donald Trump-backed Republican majority on the state
election board the rule would require officials at a polling place to match the number of ballots
tallied by voting machines with a hand-count of the number of ballots cast.
The measure has drawn bipartisan criticism in part because the board forged ahead with it so close
to Election Day.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger a Republican has noted the state took several
steps to speed up the reporting of results in Georgia this year. He has said the hand-count rule
could delay the reporting of results foster an atmosphere for misinformation and present chain of
custody issues for ballots.
The rule McBurney wrote in his order ?is too much too late.?
?This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away regardless of one?s
view of that date?s fame or infamy. Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral
process disserves the public? the judge wrote adding that while the rule appears on paper to be an
extra human check on the accuracy of the election its last-minute passage ?does not contribute to
lessening the tension or boosting the confidence of the public for this election.?
Janelle King a Republican board member criticized the ruling.
?I am deeply disappointed for the people of Georgia? King said in a statement. ?However
sometimes the victory lies in the public knowing that the State Election Board is paying closeattention to our election process.?
McBurney is overseeing a number of high-profile cases related to Georgia?s election. The judge is
considering a separate rule passed by the board in August that requires local election officials to
conduct a ?reasonable inquiry? into election results before certifying them ? a mandate that
Democrats say could give county election officials broad authority to delay or decline altogether their
certification of the results ?in a hunt for purported election irregularities.?
And on Monday he ruled that local election officials have ?a mandatory fixed obligation to certify
election results? in the days following the election ? dealing a blow to an effort by conservatives in
the critical battleground state to gain the legal right to reject results based on a suspicion of fraud or
abuse.

17,Liberal,CNN,"Kamala Harris may be the first Democratic presidential nominee to
win seniors since Al Gore
CNN ?
We?ve heard a lot about the groups of voters that Kamala Harris seems to be struggling with ? or at
least not doing as well as Joe Biden did with them four years ago. Yet the vice president has a
small national edge over Donald Trump. How is that possible?
It turns out that Harris is also doing particularly well for a Democrat among groups with whom recent
presidential nominees of her party have fared poorly.
One such group is senior citizens. Harris may be the first Democrat to carry voters aged 65 and
older since Al Gore in 2000.
Take a look at the recent national polls. The CNN/SSRS poll out this week found Harris leading the
former president 50% to 46% among senior citizens. Our survey is not an outlier. The average poll
has Harris up by 3 points over Trump among seniors.
This is a marked turnaround from before Biden dropped out of the race in July and from the final
estimates from 2020. Both the polling average from earlier this year and the post-election findings
from 2020 had Trump up by 4 points over Biden among voters who were 65 or over.
The fact that Harris is doing better with seniors than other Democrats before her isn?t the biggest
surprise. Biden did considerably better with older voters in 2020 than Barack Obama did in 2012
despite a similar national performance among all voters.Still any inroads with seniors would come at a necessary time for Harris who is struggling a bit ? for
a Democrat ? among young voters in the average national poll.
While no campaign wants to lose voters a trade of younger for older voters is potentially a good one
for Harris. There are more senior citizens than adults under 30 in America.
Moreover older Americans punch above their weight because they?re more likely to be registered
to vote and to cast a ballot. Recent polling from The New York Times/Siena College put seniors at
about 29% of the electorate compared with only about 13% for voters under 30.
Although the exact math differs depending on the state the general idea that older voters make up a
much larger share of the electorate than younger voters is true in the swing states as well.
And the power of the older voting bloc compared with the youngest one is only growing. Back in
1980 for example 22% of the electorate was under 30. Just 17% were seniors according to
estimates for the US Census Bureau. By 2000 seniors were a larger share (at 20%) than those
under 30.
Of course it is possible that the pre-election polling isn?t accurate. Four years ago there were signs
that older voters were shifting to become more Democratic. Trump would go on to win them though
by a smaller margin than one might have expected given the national vote margin.
The polling four years ago however suggested that Biden was doing better than the average
Democrat among younger voters as well which is very different from now. But as it turned out the
polling overestimated Biden?s standing among most voting groups.Interestingly this potential age depolarization among the oldest and youngest segments of the
electorate comes when we?re seeing racial depolarization as well. Trump is doing well for a
Republican among Black and Hispanic voters just as Harris is doing better than Biden was among
White voters.
I mention the racial depolarization because the math is similar for Harris. Like with age
demographics she is losing support among groups of voters who make up a smaller share of the
electorate (Black and Hispanic voters) and seems to be gaining with a bigger group (White voters).
That trade-off right now is working well enough for Harris in the polls. The question is whether it will
continue to work for her or whether Trump?s inroads among younger Black and Hispanic voters will
overwhelm any gains Harris has had with White and older voters.
Regardless of what ends up happening it does seem like there?s a good chance we see an
electorate that is less divided among certain key demographics than we?re used to seeing.",CNN_Kamala_Harris_may_be_the_first_Democratic_presiden.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Harris? direction | CNN Politics
CNN ?
The 2024 presidential electoral battleground map has proved to be remarkably stable over the past
two months after the race was reshaped with Vice President Kamala Harris? elevation to the top of
the Democratic ticket.
We are only making one tiny but quite consequential adjustment to our current ?Road to 270?
electoral map as the race heads into its final five weeks. It is possible that if we see significant
movement in the polls or in candidate and campaign investment in any of the remaining
battlegrounds we could still adjust this outlook prior to Election Day.
SEE CNN?S ROAD TO 270 INTERACTIVE MAP
In this latest installment of our Electoral College outlook we are moving the single electoral vote
awarded to the winner of Nebraska?s 2nd Congressional District from a toss-up to leaning in Harris?
direction.
Video Ad Feedback Mysterious blue dots are popping up on lawns across crucial battleground state.
Here?s what they mean 03:27 - Source: CNN
The Cornhusker State is one of two along with Maine that splits some of its electoral votes and the
vice president holds a significant lead in the battle for an electoral vote from an Omaha-area seat. A
CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released last Friday showed Harris with 53% support among
likely voters in the 2nd District compared with former President Donald Trump?s 42%. A New YorkTimes/Siena College poll released over the weekend had very similar findings. In 2020 Joe Biden
carried the district by more than 6 points on his way to winning the presidency. Harris and her allies
have dramatically outspent Trump and his backers in Nebraska and are poised to extend that
advantage in the closing five weeks of the campaign.
That one move on the map also helps demonstrate the clearest and most direct paths to the 270
electoral votes needed to win for both Harris and Trump. In polling averages of the seven toss-up
battleground states Harris performs slightly better against Trump across the Rust Belt states of
Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin than she does in the Sun Belt states of Georgia North
Carolina and Arizona. If Harris were to repeat Biden?s 2020 victories in just the three ?blue wall?
states and secure the electoral vote in the Omaha-area district we currently have leaning in her
direction she would have exactly 270 electoral votes and become the president-elect.
If Trump repeats his victories in all the states he won in 2020 he would need to flip just two states ?
Georgia and Pennsylvania ? to get to 270 electoral votes and secure a second White House term.
However that relies on North Carolina staying in his column and CNN?s most recent polling there
showed a tied race with Harris and Trump at 48% each.
As the contest enters its final 35 days tracking the resources each side is pouring into advertising to
reach the shrinking share of undecided voters and to ensure existing supporters turn out to vote can
be quite instructive about where the campaigns are placing their bets. The Harris campaign and its
Democratic allies spent nearly double the amount of ad money compared with the Trump campaign
and its Republican allies in the month of September. According to AdImpact the Democrats spent
roughly $293 million on ads in the seven battleground states last month compared with the
Republicans? $157 million investment across the same states. Three of the largest electoral prizes
on the map ? Pennsylvania Georgia and Michigan ? were home to more than 60% of the overallspending for the month.
Trump now has 24 states (and one congressional district in Maine) either solidly in his corner or
leaning in his direction totaling 219 electoral votes 51 votes short of the 270 required to win.
For her part Harris has 19 states plus the District of Columbia (and the one congressional district in
Nebraska) either solidly in her favor or leaning in her direction which brings her total electoral vote
count to 226 44 votes short of the 270 required to win.
We currently rate seven states totaling 93 electoral votes as true toss-ups.
We should be clear about what this electoral outlook is and more importantly what it is not. It is a
current snapshot of the Electoral College landscape in what will likely prove to be another very close
and extraordinarily consequential presidential election. It is not a prediction of how things will turn
out in November.
We base this current outlook on public and private polling and conversations with campaign
advisers Republican and Democratic political operatives members of Congress and political
professionals involved with outside groups poised to be active in the race.

19,Liberal,CNN,"New Georgia election rules passed by Trump-backed board are
unconstitutional judge rules | CNN Politics
CNN ?
A judge in Georgia has struck down a slate of controversial new election rules passed by Donald
Trump allies including two that Democrats say would inject post-election ?chaos? into the critical
battleground state.
Among the rules Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox said violated state law are two
that would require county election officials to conduct a ?reasonable inquiry? into election results
before certifying them and allow them to ?examine all election related documentation created during
the conduct of elections prior to certification of results.?
?The court here declares that these rules are illegal unconstitutional and void? Cox wrote in
Wednesday?s ruling.
Georgia?s 16 electoral votes are crucial for both Trump and Democratic nominee Vice President
Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden won the state by just over 10000 votes in 2020.
Early voting began in the Peach State on Tuesday with record turnout.
Three GOP members of the Georgia State Election Board were thrust into the spotlight after Trump
mentioned them by name at a rally in Atlanta this summer.
?They?re on fire. They are doing a great job? Trump said during his August 3 speech in Atlanta.
?Three members ? all pit bulls fighting for transparency honesty and victory.?After their passage in August the two rules were quickly challenged by Democrats and others who
feared that that they would give officials in the state broad authority to delay or decline altogether
their certification of the results in order to look for alleged election fraud or abuse.
But Cox said in his ruling that the ?reasonable inquiry? rule ?adds an additional and undefined step
into the certification process? and that the ?examination? rule ?creates a statutorily unbounded
scope under which (election) superintendents can consider unauthorized materials when tabulating
canvassing and certifying election results.?
The GOP-controlled State Election Board has claimed that the rules give no discretion to county
officials but what constitutes a ?reasonable inquiry? has left voting rights advocates Democrats
and others challenging the rules concerned that a partisan election county official may be able to

20,Liberal,CNN,"Obama?s reemergence on the campaign trail for Harris comes as he
recognizes his own legacy is at stake
CNN ?
America and the world have a lot riding on who wins in November. So does Barack Obama.
And that?s part of what is powering what people familiar with Obama?s plans told CNN will be the
most active closing weeks of an election the former president?s had since his own last campaign.
More rallies are coming every week. This past Wednesday alone he recorded 21 videos for the
Harris campaign. More ads for Democratic Senate candidates are already in the can. Content with
influencers will keep popping online. He?ll even be doing a few interviews of his own.
This is on top of a range of meetings and phone calls Obama has held over the last year with
Kamala Harris Joe Biden and other top Democrats first reported by CNN as advisers friends and
political allies say the former president has become increasingly alarmed by Donald Trump?s
continued hold on the country and its politics.
Obama no longer thinks he can get to the people locked in with Trump.
He?s just hoping to help find enough votes in enough states to counter them.
If the vice president wins Obama will feel vindicated and in many ways will be released to more of
the post-presidency he?d been hoping for since right before he called to congratulate Trump on
election night 2016 ? the first time (and ultimately one of the few times) the two spoke.
But a thought has circulated among several people close to the former president they told CNN: IfTrump wins Obama might be seen as the aberration in the history of American politics rather than
Trump and his nativist authoritarianism. Obama acolytes have spent the last eight years rationalizing
Trump as the last gasp backlash to the Democrat and his presidency.
Obama always wanted to stay involved in politics just more as an emeritus elder steering what
came after him without as many rallies and constant calls to swoop in and save the party. He would
like to see his theory proved true that stepping back wasn?t just about making money off of
podcasting with Bruce Springsteen or narrating a documentary series about parks for Netflix ? as
some resentful Democrats came to feel ? but about letting new people emerge without his shadow.
?The goal has always been to pass the torch to the next generation of leaders to ensure the party is
sustainable long term without him? said Hannah Hankins a spokesperson for the former president
who first worked for him in the White House.
All that and the survival of much of what he put in place as president depends on his main mission
for the fall: breaking through to young Black men as he is uniquely situated to do hoping they don?t
give up on the Democratic Party in the high numbers that even internal Harris-aligned campaign
polling show may be happening.
That poured out of Obama on Thursday when ahead of his first campaign rally in Pittsburgh he
turned what was supposed to be a perfunctory stop by a Harris office into a visceral calling out of
young Black men for ?coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses? for not supporting Harris
abandoning their communities and themselves. He said he feared that they are either being fooled
by Trump or ?you just aren?t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.?
Obama can still draw a crowd. A dozen of the 4500 people packing a gym on the University ofPittsburgh campus on Thursday night told CNN in interviews that they still feel connected to him ?
including a 15-year-old named Kai Jones wearing a T-shirt printed with the famous photo of Obama
and Biden jogging through the Rose Garden. Jones who wasn?t yet born in 2008 said Obama
?has a special place in my heart.?
But if the question remains: Can Obama draw in those young Black men? On Thursday in
Pittsburgh there weren?t as many of those faces in the crowd.
?The fact that he has not been in the day-to-day political scene people don?t see him in the
partisan muck that everybody else? Austin Davis the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor and a
35-year-old Black man himself told CNN ahead of the rally. ?You have to think about the type of
people who naturally show up to political rallies. It?s not just the crowd here it?s the crowd that?s
watching at home.?
Campaign strategy meetings and advice on Washington
Most of the Democratic work Obama has been doing the last few years has been behind the
scenes. A lot has been with Hakeem Jeffries the New York congressman hoping to become the
next speaker of the House whose connection to the former president runs so deep that as he
sometimes points out he has the same birthday.
After their own one-on-one meeting Obama asked Jeffries to suggest a few small groups of
Democratic House members for trips to his office in the World Wildlife Federation in northwest
Washington. The members ranged from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to much lesser
known and less progressive up-and-comers like Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and
Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola. He talked to them about coming off like real people rather than scoldingcoastal elites and staying consistent rather than being pulled into the whirlwind of Washington
consultant advice according to people in the room.
Several took written notes including a nervous congressman who watched Obama play with an
aide?s child before their meeting started and wrote down to focus on learning how to charm babies
according to one of the people who saw it.
Obama?s session last November with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the incumbent
Democratic senators running in 2024 was more focused on briefing Obama on their races so he
could better understand their challenges and offer support.
?It was great to be able to begin the strategy with him? said Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey whom
Obama has liked since they were in the Senate together and whom the former president insisted be
seated onstage to be in the shot with him throughout Thursday?s rally in Pittsburgh.
Casey later came by for his own separate meeting as did Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego
the Democratic Senate nominees in Michigan and Arizona. The list goes on and includes
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro who stopped by a year before he became an Obama world
favorite in this summer?s running mate search for Harris.
Campaigning in Pennsylvania a few hours before heading to Obama?s speech Thursday though
Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said he?s ready to step forward and help pull Harris and other Democrats
over the line.
Asked whether he was ready to see Obama hold to his theory of turning over to the next generation
of Democrats Kelly said ?Not yet.?Navigating Biden and coming around on Harris
Obama had hoped to start stepping back when Biden won. Neither president was thrilled with how
the last few years played out between them.
Long before Biden?s dismal debate in June the president had been complaining privately that
Obama wasn?t helping enough according to several people who spoke to Biden. Biden aides
sensed a jealousy from Obama?s orbit that they were racking up more accomplishments than he
had with senior adviser Mike Donilon saying once in private conversation ?They need to get over
it? according to one of the people who heard it ? and Biden aides hated the Republican conspiracy
theory that Obama was actually pulling the strings.
For over a year when Biden wanted a former president sounding board he was ringing up Bill
Clinton instead.
After Biden?s debate debacle diehards burned that Obama had left the president to twist in the
wind when he could have more forcefully ended the questions while many Democrats suffering
through that month felt he was going feckless again. Many calls came in.
Biden?s dropping out sparked its own Obama drama and not just because the president?s
immediate endorsement of Harris came with the added benefit of demonstrating a deference he
often complained he never got from his old boss. While most of the party leaders Harris called that
Sunday afternoon including Bill Clinton immediately pledged support Obama held off. He offered
advice and encouragement but told her he wanted to make sure the process was seen as legitimate
in a way it might not have if he had jumped out early.Harris advisers knew Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi favored an open process to
find a new nominee. What some couldn?t figure out was how much of that was Obama?s doubts
and disappointments about Harris from her 2019 campaign and early vice presidency shining
through and how much was a political calculation that she would be better off if she emerged after a
process rather than a coronation.
Several people familiar with Obama?s thinking said that he thought she was in the strongest
position starting out but he believed others would run ? and that he was pleased to see her talking
that week about earning the nomination even as others didn?t. When the Obamas called Harris that
Wednesday to officially endorse his argument was that he was acting as the closer certifying party
unity even as some outsiders complained it looked like he had held out as long as he could.
Obama and Biden have spoken once since the president dropped out. Obama initiated the
conversation telling aides to let the White House know he was eager for a call whenever Biden had
time and they soon spoke. It wasn?t the two presidents? deepest or longest conversation. Obama
said he appreciated all that Biden had done as president and how hard stepping aside was. He said
he loved him like a brother and always would. Biden took the call to heart without hard feelings. He
thanked Obama for reaching out.
Obama has had several conversations with Harris whom he first got to know through an informal
network of up-and-coming Black politicians when he was a state senator and she was a district
attorney. One centered entirely on her running mate selection though he was giving his take on how
she should approach the process rather than weighing in for one candidate. Others have been to
help guide her through everything from staffing decisions to bigger picture strategy. And according
to people who know about the conversations he checks in with several of his own closest aides nowhelping run Harris? campaign such as current campaign chair Jen O?Malley Dillon and his own
2008 campaign manager David Plouffe.
In both public and in private conversations Obama has heaped praise on Harris for the way she?s
campaigned and what she?s campaigning on.
Meanwhile conversations are underway to get Michelle Obama to carry through with her own ?do
something? speech from August?s Democratic National Convention. She?s expected to do an event
or two ? but not much more than that.
?He doesn?t feel like history?
Standing in the gym waiting for Obama Paige Mirsky a 24-year-old biochemistry graduate student
originally from Buffalo said that part of the reason she was there was because watching his
convention speech ?made me want to actually do something.?
?He feels like the future? she said.
She acknowledged that she had been all of 8 when Obama first won that she hadn?t been steeped
in the details of his record in office and that he has been out of the White House a long time
already.
Obama?s leaving office was ?a turning point? Mirsky said. ?That was the last time anybody felt
normal.?
A few feet over a 64-year-old physics professor named Eric Swanson who had grown up in Canadabefore becoming a US citizen said that watching Obama in Grant Park on election night 2008 was
?the only time I felt proud to be an American.?
He said he?s hoping to feel that same feeling with Harris. He doesn?t feel it yet. Maybe Swanson
said Obama would get him there.
A clump of Pitt freshmen found spots in the middle of the floor waving to friends and making sure
they?d still have the sight lines right to the man himself.
?My parents talk about him a lot? Amelia Staresink said explaining why she felt connected to a
president who had left office when they were in fourth grade.
?He doesn?t feel like history? said Sara Kulkarni.
With as much as they feel like they keep seeing him ?it?s an active history? Eve Majewski said.
In the 2022 midterms Obama?s decision to rip into Republicans as a threat to Social Security
pushed the topic into a main talking point for Democrats in the final stretch. With the energy around
Harris flagging the prods he debuted in Pittsburgh go far beyond how he called out young Black
men: viciously mocking Trump as an out-of-touch and self-centered whiner tearing into Trump?s
claims of credit for managing a good economy then finishing with a long ?Why would we go along
with this?? section about Trump?s division and disinformation that betrayed Obama?s deep
frustration with the Republican nominee?s hold on America.
Onstage Obama was riffing so much that he picked up a shoutout from the crowd about Trump
wearing a diaper.?I almost said it but I decided I should not say it? he said with a big smile and shake of his head.
When Obama feels like a speech has caught the way he wanted it to he smacks the side of the
lectern. Sometimes twice a fast double tap.
Thursday night when he finished in Pittsburgh he backed up from the microphone for a moment
without doing it. Then he stepped forward again and brought his hand down hard right in the center.

21,Liberal,CNN,"Republicans are challenging all aspects of mail-in voting in
battleground states | CNN Politics
CNN ?
After mail-in and absentee voting reached new levels in the 2020 election during the Covid-19
pandemic a wave of lawsuits over the popular vote-casting methods this year is laying the
groundwork for potential challenges to the outcome of the November presidential election.
Key swing states like North Carolina Pennsylvania Nevada and Michigan are still experiencing a
high volume of mail-in and absentee voting. That has prompted multiple lawsuits in battleground
states where Republicans are suing to challenge everything from whether mail-in ballot envelopes
are properly sealed to whether they are postmarked correctly.
Democrats for their part have embraced mail-in and absentee balloting and are waging their own
legal fights to ensure these votes are counted. Democrats championed access to this type of voting
in 2020 to ease concerns of citizens who felt unsafe going to polling sites in-person during the
pandemic and it?s still a major focus of their get-out-the-vote efforts.
Republicans on the other hand have been more skeptical. Former President Donald Trump has
given mixed signals on the campaign trail. After his 2020 loss he has railed against mail-in voting
saying this summer it ?isn?t working it?s corrupt.? But he also emphasizes that every vote matters
including early voting and absentee ballots.
?We need each and every one of you to make a plan to vote early and vote absentee. Do whatever
you want? Trump said at a rally last month in Erie Pennsylvania.With absentee and mail-in voting already underway in several states and the race between Trump
and Vice President Kamala Harris as close as ever the outcome of litigation over these ballots could
help decide the election.
?We?re at a stage now where voting is already occurring? Paul Cox general counsel for the North
Carolina State Board of Elections told CNN in an interview. ?We are mindful that in close elections
there?s always going to be the temptation or the interest of one party or another to challenge the
results.?
North Carolina
In North Carolina state and national Republican Party affiliates sued the North Carolina State Board
of Elections in September in an attempt to invalidate absentee ballots that are not properly sealed in
their envelopes.
Starting on October 1 North Carolina counties began qualifying their absentee ballots. Every
Tuesday county election officials convene to process absentee ballots. The meetings are open to
the public.
In Wake County North Carolina the county Board of Elections is a bipartisan group of five
members: two Democrats two Republicans and one chair appointed by the governor. The board
members take turns carefully examining each ballot to make sure it is signed and dated properly the
envelope is sealed correctly and to search for any other flaw that may disqualify the ballot.
Wake County Board of Elections member Keith Weatherly signs a box of mail-in ballots at the Wake
County Board of Elections ballot processing center in Raleigh North Carolina. CNN?Sometimes there?s missing witness information or missing notary information or the voter didn?t
sign. So these are things that we catch? board member Greg Flynn said after their first meeting for
this election.
In the 2020 election absentee voting appeared to favor Joe Biden in North Carolina as more than
260000 more Democrats requested absentee ballots compared to Republicans though he did not
win the state. There is currently no clear frontrunner between Harris and Trump in the key state.
Cox noted that in North Carolina state law allows election workers to begin preparing for Election
Day early. That enables them to start the vote counting early on ?so we don?t have everything
crushing in at the very last moment.?
Pennsylvania
In Pennsylvania where the presidential race also is tight and could be contested there are several
ongoing lawsuits regarding mail-in ballots and absentee ballots.
The Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit to the
state?s Supreme Court seeking to end the mail-in ballot ?notice-and-cure? procedures. These allow
voters in some counties to fix issues found on their ballot such as a wrong date or missing signature
on the envelope so that they can still be counted.
In a separate case Democrats sued to strike down a state law that disqualifies a mail-in ballot if the
envelope is missing the date or has the incorrect date listed.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear both cases over the weekend. But the RNC
could bring cases after the election dealing with similar issues.
Some state officials are trying to address any problems before a ballot is cast. In Pennsylvania
officials have created educational videos for voters about the mail-in and absentee ballot process
with step-by-step instructions to ensure fewer ballots get disqualified.
Nevada
In Nevada an appeal before the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that was brought by the RNC is
challenging Nevada?s Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar over postmarked receipts on mail-in ballots.
Nevada state law allows ballots to be counted if they are received up to four business days past
Election Day.
The RNC argues that Nevada law is detrimental to Republican candidates because Republicans
contend Democratic candidates are more likely to prevail with mail-in ballots counted after Election
Day.
Mail-in ballots wait to be processed on a table at the Wake County Board of Elections in Raleigh
North Carolina. CNN
Michigan
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson also faced a lawsuit from the RNC alleging the state
has not given complete guidance on how absentee ballots should be verified particularly when it
comes to verifying voter signatures.?Despite this clear statutory framework it appears that local clerks may not be complying with the
requirement to mark absent voter ballot envelopes with a statement that the voter?s signature has
been verified? the complaint said.
The case was settled late last month with Benson agreeing to adjust the guidance to tell local clerks
they must mark the envelopes after verifying voters? signatures.
In a separate case Republicans challenged guidance from Benson saying that mail ballots that
aren?t matched with their corresponding envelope should be noted as ?challenged? with options
for curing instead of ?rejected? outright. Benson?s office says this has been the guidance in the
state since 1996 and has been issued by Republican and Democratic officials.
A judge recently ordered Benson to update the guidance to make it clear that election workers
?must? ? not ?should? ? verify that the number on the ballot matches the number on the envelope.
Regardless of the RNC filing legal challenges in Michigan to disqualify absentee ballots the
Chairman of the Michigan Republican Party Pete Hoekstra on Monday posted a photo of him
voting via an absentee ballot on X.

22,Liberal,CNN,"She was accused of murder after losing her pregnancy. SC woman
now tells her story | CNN
Orangeburg South Carolina KFF Health News ?
Amari Marsh had just finished her junior year at South Carolina State University in May 2023 when
she received a text message from a law enforcement officer.
?Sorry it has taken this long for paperwork to come back? the officer wrote. ?But I finally have the
final report and wanted to see if you and your boyfriend could meet me Wednesday afternoon for a
follow up??
Marsh understood that the report was related to a pregnancy loss she?d experienced that March
she said. During her second trimester Marsh said she unexpectedly gave birth in the middle of the
night while on a toilet in her off-campus apartment. She remembered screaming and panicking and
said the bathroom was covered in blood.
?I couldn?t breathe? said Marsh now 23.
The next day when Marsh woke up in the hospital she said a law enforcement officer asked her
questions. Then a few weeks later she said she received a call saying she could collect her
daughter?s ashes.
At that point she said she didn?t know she was being criminally investigated. Yet three months
after her loss Marsh was charged with murder/homicide by child abuse law enforcement records
show. She spent 22 days at the Orangeburg-Calhoun Regional Detention Center where she was
initially held without bond facing 20 years to life in prison.This August 13 months after she was released from jail to house arrest with an ankle monitor
Marsh was cleared by a grand jury. Her case will not proceed to trial.
Amari's father Herman Marsh here with wife Regina thought his daughter's situation was a bad
joke until reality set in. ?I told my wife I said ?We need to get an attorney now.?? Sam Wolfe for
KFF Health News
Her story raises questions about the state of reproductive rights in this country disparities in health
care and pregnancy criminalization especially for Black women like Marsh. More than two years
after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs v. Jackson Women?s Health Organization decision
which allowed states to outlaw abortion the climate around these topics remains highly charged.
Marsh?s case also highlights what?s at stake in November. Sixty-one percent of voters want
Congress to pass a federal law restoring a nationwide right to abortion according to a recent poll by
KFF the health policy research polling and news organization that includes KFF Health News.
These issues could shape who wins the White House and controls Congress and will come to a
head for voters in the 10 states where ballot initiatives about abortion will be decided.
This case shows how pregnancy loss is being criminalized around the country said U.S. Rep.
James Clyburn a Democrat and graduate of South Carolina State University whose congressional
district includes Orangeburg.
?This is not a slogan when we talk about this being an ?election about the restoration of our
freedoms?? Clyburn said.?I was scared?
When Marsh took an at-home pregnancy test in November 2022 the positive result scared her. ?I
didn?t know what to do. I didn?t want to let my parents down? she said. ?I was in a state of shock.?
She didn?t seek prenatal care she said because she kept having her period. She thought the
pregnancy test might have been wrong.
An incident report filed by the Orangeburg County Sheriff?s Office on the day she lost the
pregnancy stated that in January 2023 Marsh made an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic
in Columbia to ?take the Plan-C pill which would possibly cause an abortion to occur.? The report
doesn?t specify whether she took ? or even obtained ? the drug.
During an interview at her parents? house Marsh denied going to Planned Parenthood or taking
medicine to induce abortion.
?I?ve never been in trouble. I?ve never been pulled over. I?ve never been arrested? Marsh said. ?I
never even got written up in school.?
She played clarinet as section leader in the marching band and once performed at Carnegie Hall. In
college she was majoring in biology and planned to become a doctor.
South Carolina state Rep. Seth Rose a Democrat in Columbia and one of Marsh?s attorneys called
it a ?really tragic? case. ?It?s our position that she lost a child through natural causes? he said.
On Feb. 28 2023 Marsh said she experienced abdominal pain that was ?way worse? than regularmenstrual cramps. She went to the emergency room investigation records show but left after
several hours without being treated. Back at home she said the pain grew worse. She returned to
the hospital this time by ambulance.
Hospital staffers crowded around her she said and none of them explained what was happening to
her. Bright lights shone in her face. ?I was scared? she said.
According to the sheriff?s department report hospital staffers told Marsh that she was pregnant and
that a fetal heartbeat could be detected. Freaked out and confused she chose to leave the hospital
a second time she said and her pain had subsided.
In the middle of the night she said the pain started again. She woke up she recalled feeling an
intense urge to use the bathroom. ?And when I did the child came? she said. ?I screamed because
I was scared because I didn?t know what was going on.?
Her boyfriend at the time called 911. The emergency dispatcher ?kept telling me to take the baby
out? of the toilet she recalled. ?I couldn?t because I couldn?t even keep myself together.?
First medical responders detected signs of life and tried to perform lifesaving measures as they
headed to Regional Medical Center in Orangeburg the incident report said. But at the hospital
Marsh learned that her infant a girl had not survived.
?I kept asking to see the baby? she said. ?They wouldn?t let me.?
Zipporah Sumpter Amari Marsh?s attorney says law enforcement treated her client as a criminal
instead of a grieving mother. ?This is not a criminal matter? Sumpter says. Sam Wolfe for KFFHealth News
The following day a sheriff?s deputy told Marsh in her hospital room that the incident was under
investigation but said that Marsh ?was currently not in any trouble? according to the report. Marsh
responded that ?she did not feel as though she did anything wrong.?
More than 10 weeks later nothing about the text messages she received from an officer in mid-May
implied that the follow-up meeting about the final report was urgent.
?Oh it doesn?t have to be Wednesday it can be next week or another week? the officer wrote in an
exchange that Marsh shared with KFF Health News. ?I just have to meet with y?all in person before
I can close the case out. I am so sorry?
?No problem I understand? Marsh wrote back.
She didn?t tell her parents or consider hiring a lawyer. ?I didn?t think I needed one? she said.
Marsh arranged to meet the officer on June 2 2023. During that meeting she was arrested. Her
boyfriend was not charged.
Her father Herman Marsh the band director at a local public school in Orangeburg thought it was a
bad joke until reality set in. ?I told my wife I said ?We need to get an attorney now.??
Pregnancy criminalization
When Marsh lost her pregnancy on March 1 2023 women in South Carolina could still obtain anabortion until 20 weeks beyond fertilization or the gestational age of 22 weeks.
Later that spring South Carolina?s Republican-controlled legislature passed a ban that prohibits
providers from performing abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected with some
exceptions made for cases of rape incest or when the mother?s life is in jeopardy. That law does
not allow criminal penalties for women who seek or obtain abortions.
Solicitor David Pascoe a Democrat elected to South Carolina?s 1st Judicial Circuit whose office
handled Marsh?s prosecution said the issues of abortion and reproductive rights weren?t relevant
to this case.
?It had nothing to do with that? he told KFF Health News.
The arrest warrant alleges that not moving the infant from the toilet at the urging of the dispatcher
was ultimately ?a proximate cause of her daughter?s death.? The warrant also cites as the cause of
death ?respiratory complications? due to a premature delivery stemming from a maternal chlamydia
infection. Marsh said she was unaware of the infection until after the pregnancy loss.
Pascoe said the question raised by investigators was whether Marsh failed to render aid to the
infant before emergency responders arrived at the apartment he said. Ultimately the grand jury
decided there wasn?t probable cause to proceed with a criminal trial he said. ?I respect the grand
jury?s opinion.?
Marsh?s case is a ?prime example of how pregnancy loss can become a criminal investigation very
quickly? said Dana Sussman senior vice president of Pregnancy Justice a nonprofit that tracks
such cases. While similar cases predate the Supreme Court?s Dobbs decision she said they seemto be increasing.
?The Dobbs decision unleashed and empowered prosecutors to look at pregnant people as a
suspect class and at pregnancy loss as a suspicious event? she said.
Local and national anti-abortion groups seized on Marsh?s story when her name and mug shot were
published online by The Times and Democrat of Orangeburg. Holly Gatling executive director of
South Carolina Citizens for Life wrote a blog post about Marsh titled in part ?Orangeburg Newborn
Dies in Toilet? that was published by National Right to Life. Gatling and National Right to Life did not
respond to interview requests.
Marsh said she made the mistake of googling herself when she was released from jail.
?It was heartbreaking to see all those things? she said. ?I cried so many times.?
Some physicians are also afraid of being painted as criminals. The nonprofit Physicians for Human
Rights published a report on Sept. 17 about Florida?s six-week abortion ban that included input from
two dozen doctors many of whom expressed fear about the criminal penalties imposed by the law.
?The health care systems are afraid? said Michele Heisler medical director for the nonprofit.
?There?s all these gray areas. So everyone is just trying to be extra careful. Unfortunately as a
result patients are suffering.?
Chelsea Daniels a family medicine doctor who works for Planned Parenthood in Miami and
performs abortions said that in early September she saw a patient who had a miscarriage during
the first trimester of her pregnancy. The patient had been to four hospitals and brought in theultrasound scans performed at each facility.
?No one would touch her? Daniels said. ?Each ultrasound scan she brought in represents on the
other side a really terrified doctor who is doing their best to interpret the really murky legal language
around abortion care and miscarriage management which are the same things essentially.?
Florida is one of the 10 states with a ballot measure related to abortion in November although it is
the only Southern state with one. Others are Montana Missouri and Maryland.
?I found my strength?
Zipporah Sumpter one of Marsh?s lawyers said the law enforcement system treated her client as a
criminal instead of a grieving mother. ?This is not a criminal matter? Sumpter said.
It was not just the fraught climate around pregnancy that caused Marsh to suffer; ?race definitely
played a factor? said Sumpter who does not believe Marsh received compassionate care when she
went to the hospital the first or second time.
The management of Regional Medical Center where Marsh was treated changed shortly after her
hospitalization. The hospital is now managed by the Medical University of South Carolina and its
spokesperson declined to comment on Marsh?s case

Historically birth outcomes for Black women in Orangeburg County where Marsh lost herpregnancy have ranked among the worst in South Carolina. From 2020 through 2022 the average
mortality rate for Black infants born in Orangeburg County was more than three times as high as the
average rate for white infants statewide.
Today Marsh is still trying to process all that happened. She moved back in with her parents and is
seeing a therapist. She is taking classes at a local community college and hopes to reenroll at South
Carolina State University to earn a four-year degree. She still wants to become a doctor. She keeps
her daughter?s ashes on a bookshelf in her bedroom.
?Through all of this I found my strength. I found my voice. I want to help other young women that
are in my position now and will be in the future? she said. ?I always had faith that God was going to
be on my side but I didn?t know how it was going to go with the justice system we have today.?

23,Liberal,CNN,"Speaker Johnson unveils short-term spending bill urges members to
avoid shutdown | CNN Politics
CNN ?
House Speaker Mike Johnson laid out the next plans to avert a government shutdown in a Sunday
letter to his members.
Johnson?s plan known as a limited continuing resolution would fund the government until
December 20 and include $230 million for Secret Service funding.
?Next week the House will take the initiative and pass a clean three-month CR to prevent the
Senate from jamming us with a bill loaded with billions in new spending and unrelated provisions?
the Louisiana Republican wrote in his letter. ?Our legislation will be a very narrow bare-bones CR
including only the extensions that are absolutely necessary. While this is not the solution any of us
prefer it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances.?
Government funding is slated to run out at the end of the month and Johnson said in his Sunday
letter that he does not want a shutdown weeks before the election.
?As history has taught and current polling affirms shutting the government down less than 40 days
from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice? he said. ?From now until election
day I will continue with my tireless efforts and singular focus of growing our majority for the 119th
Congress.?
The top Democrats in Congress House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer praised bipartisan negotiations that led to a funding agreement ?free ofcuts and poison pills? and signaled swift passage of the stopgap bill ahead of the deadline.
?If both sides continue to work in good faith I am hopeful that we can wrap up work on the CR this
week well before the September 30 deadline. The key to finishing our work this week will be
bipartisan cooperation in both chambers? Schumer said in a statement Sunday.
Jeffries signaled House Democrats will evaluate the spending legislation as members return to
Washington on Monday evening but praised the negotiated legislation as ?devoid of any partisan
right-wing policy changes.?
Johnson?s bill comes after the House failed on Wednesday to pass a six-month GOP government
funding plan that included a controversial measure targeting noncitizen voting an effort pushed by
Donald Trump. The former president had called for a government shutdown if lawmakers cannot get
the voting measure known as the SAVE Act passed into law.
Johnson said Friday that he believes Trump understands House Republicans don?t have the votes
to pass the SAVE Act a GOP-led bill that passed the House in July. The measure would require
documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections despite the fact that it is
already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections.

24,Liberal,CNN,"Trump says women won?t be ?thinking about abortion? if he?s
elected casting himself as their ?protector? | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Former President Donald Trump cast himself as a ?protector? of women at a Pennsylvania rally
Monday evening and claimed that American women won?t be ?thinking about abortion? if he?s
elected.
The plea to ignore Trump?s own role in undoing national abortion rights protections is a clear signal
that the former president is keenly aware of what polls show: His Democratic rival Vice President
Kamala Harris has a clear advantage among women voters nationally and in key swing states.
Trump has kept the race close by countering with a lead among men.
Harris? edge with women is driven in part by the Supreme Court?s conservative majority with three
members appointed by Trump in 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade and leading to a patchwork of
state-level abortion regulations ? including restrictive laws in several of the battleground states that
could decide the 2024 election. Democrats have performed strongly in elections where abortion has
taken center stage since that 2022 Supreme Court decision and abortion rights supporters have
won a series of statewide referendums on the issue even in deep-red states.
?I always thought women liked me. I never thought I had a problem. But the fake news keeps saying
women don?t like me? Trump said in Indiana Pennsylvania. ?I don?t believe it.?
The former president claimed women are ?less safe? ?much poorer? and are ?less healthy? now
compared to when he was president and vowed to end what he described as their ?national
nightmare.??Because I am your protector. I want to be your protector. As president I have to be your protector.
I hope you don?t make too much of it. I hope the fake news doesn?t go ?Oh he wants to be their
protector.? Well I am. As president I have to be your protector? Trump said.
Women he added ?will be happy healthy confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about
abortion.?
Polls also show likely voters give Harris the edge on handling abortion. Polls also show likely voters
give Harris the edge on handling abortion. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Tuesday found
likely voters nationally favor Harris? approach to abortion (52%) to Trump?s (31%). That advantage
was in line with several other national surveys released this month.
Even in polls that indicate Trump has a lead ? such as a New York Times/Siena College poll of
Arizona likely voters released Monday which found Trump leading with 48% support to Harris? 43%
? it?s clear Trump faces political headwinds on the issue of abortion rights. A broad majority (58%)
of voters said they would vote to back a ballot measure seeking to establish a right to abortion in the
state while 35% oppose it.
Americans remain broadly opposed to the Supreme Court?s decision to overturn Roe according to
CNN polling and it has proven to be thorny campaign issue for Republicans in down-ballot races.
Bernie Moreno the GOP candidate for US Senate in Ohio said at a town hall Friday that abortion is
the only issue many suburban women vote on and questioned why women over 50 would care
about the issue according to video obtained by WCMH-TV in Columbus Ohio.A spokesperson for Moreno later sought to call his remarks ?a tongue-in-cheek joke? though his
opponent incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown has already seized on the comments.
Trump appeared to be referring to Democrats later in his speech Monday when he said ?all they
can talk about is abortion.?
?The country is falling apart. We?re going to end up in World War III and all they can talk about is
abortion. That?s all they talk about and it really no longer pertains because we?ve done something
on abortion that nobody thought was possible? he said in reference to the Supreme Court?s 2022
decision.
Trump had previewed his Monday evening appeal to female women voters with a post on his Truth
Social platform last week. American women he wrote in all-caps ?are more depressed and
unhappy than they were four years ago? before vowing to ?fix all of that.?
Harris in a Wisconsin Public Radio interview on Tuesday reiterated her support for eliminating the
Senate?s 60-vote filibuster threshold to restore Roe v. Wade to codify abortion rights and protect
women?s reproductive freedom.
?I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe? Harris said.
Doing so she said would ?get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually
put back into law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person every
woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to
do.?CNN?s Ebony Davis and Jenn Agiesta contributed to this report.",CNN_Trump_says_women_won’t_be_‘thinking_about_abortion.pdf.pdf,news_articles
25,Liberal,CNN,"What CNN?s Phil Mattingly learned from voters about why the US
economy is their top issue in the 2024 election
A version of this story appeared in CNN?s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox sign up
for free here.
CNN ?
Most voters cite the economy as their top concern but it?s impossible to pin down since it affects
every voter in a personal situational and unique way.
Contradictions abound.
The massive and expensive effort to kickstart American manufacturing with a green industry is
paying off in places that reject the lawmakers who passed it.
Both presidential candidates are making bold promises about tax cuts they likely can?t keep in an
effort to appeal to voters who feel pinched.
Voters still shocked by inflation have a nostalgia for lower prices they experienced during the
Donald Trump years but his promise to raise tariffs will according to most economists raise prices.
CNN?s chief domestic correspondent Phil Mattingly set out on a whirlwind road trip to look at the
economy. It?s an interesting series and yielded multiple engaging video reports.
I talked to Mattingly by email about what he was trying to do and what he learned. Our conversation
is below.What?s going on in the ?Show Me the Money? series
WOLF: I heard you say you went to five states in seven days and talked to dozens of people about
the economy which also happens to be the No. 1 issue in the coming election. Where did you go
and what were you trying to find out?
MATTINGLY: I?ve been thinking about the basic outlines of this project for the better part of the last
eight or nine months believe it or not.
The genesis was actually my time as chief White House correspondent where I was intensely
focused on the Biden-Harris administration?s economic policy and implementation of its sweeping
legislative wins. The scale ? and the ideological shift toward embracing industrial policy in certain
sectors ? has long been fascinating to me.
But more fascinating to me has been the disconnect between the consistently positive and robust
macroeconomic numbers and the reality that in poll after poll people on the ground either weren?t
feeling it or weren?t buying it.
Over several months I?ve been quietly collecting examples of communities in key electoral states
that kind of fit into a few key buckets:
Clear-cut comeback stories. Places where specific promises were made by politicians in both
parties. Places that carry a ton of political importance but are lagging in their recovery compared
with similar regions.From there we picked Lordstown Ohio (bucket No. 2); Erie Pennsylvania and Saginaw Michigan
(bucket No. 3); and Dalton and Cartersville Georgia (bucket No. 1.).
Honestly ? and I had a lot of conversations with my stellar producer Andrew Seger Jeremy
Moorhead and our great team of photojournalists about this throughout ? we didn?t land in these
places with any kind of a baked story or outline. Quite the opposite.
My whole goal was to just talk to people I thought had unique but tangible perspectives about their
personal experiences and their communities. Only then would I have an idea of how I wanted to
thread those together with what I?ve long reported on in the policy economy and political space.

Green investment in red counties
WOLF: We have the unfortunate tendency to talk about ?the economy? in a monolithic way but
everyone?s economy is different. How did the different people you talked to view the economy right
now?
MATTINGLY: This is a great question because it contains such an important piece of what we found
in every single place.
There is no ?story of the economy.? There are *stories* about people?s individual experiences.
Those stories fit into the *stories* about the experiences of a community.The community?s stories aren?t unfurling in a vacuum ? they are deeply connected for better or
worse in the global economic trends over decades and the policy decisions made at the federal
state and local levels over that same period.
Look it?s no secret that on the individual level inflation has had a significant effect on how people
make decisions. For the lower end of the income scale they?ve in many cases been crippling.
That?s a through line in every conversation we?ve had.
But on the community level these anecdotal windows into how the policy decisions made at the
federal state and local level knit together ? or don?t ? are so important to understanding why some
regions are doing better than others.
Take our third piece which takes place in northwest Georgia. This is Trump country right? Like
75-80% Trump counties. But these counties had local governments that after being decimated by
the Great Recession started thinking through what was needed to diversify their local economies.
Infrastructure housing utilities ? all of it.
That was taking place as a very conservative Republican governor Brian Kemp made incentivizing
a new era of manufacturing a central component of his economic agenda.
Add in the Biden-Harris administration?s hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure green
technology and semiconductor investments and all of a sudden you have a recipe for a major
breakthrough.

Many don?t believe in climate change and are extraordinarily skeptical of the green energy
transition. But they love the jobs and economic growth.
To me it?s such a fascinating convergence of factors that on their face would seem almost
impossible in our current polarized state.
Every vote counts in a marginal election
WOLF: One theme I see in your reports is that people who were not helped by Trump?s policies ?
General Motors workers forced to leave a plant in Lordstown Ohio that shut down on his watch and
farmers hurt by a trade battle with China ? still support him. What?s your take after this trip?
Video Ad Feedback Trump's promises to auto plant workers fell short. Why some say they'll still vote
for him 04:43 - Source: CNN
MATTINGLY: This isn?t going to be revelatory by any means but I think the reality is that Trump
connects to a certain segment of society ? blue-collar White men in particular ? on a visceral level
that isn?t easily countered. His blunt-force rhetoric hits all the notes that resonate even if his
policies from his first term don?t match. On its face it doesn?t make a ton of sense.
But on some level I have the benefit of being from Ohio where all of my friends back home are big
Trump supporters. So for me that part wasn?t a surprise.
What was notable at least in my experience was talking to the union leaders or farmers who *do*view Trump?s first term as presenting a crystal-clear policy contrast through which voting for him (or
voting for him again) is impossible. And their frustration in trying to reach their colleagues is
palpable.
One thing I?d note though is that with the way this election is shaping up every single one of these
votes matter in places like Erie or Saginaw. These are places that went (for Barack) Obama twice
then Trump then back to (Joe) Biden and were only separated by a thousand or few hundred votes.
So we weren?t chasing pockets of Democrats in deep-red counties just to talk to Democrats. We
were talking to folks who if they can peel off enough folks like themselves at the margins could
quite literally decide the election.
The inverse is true as well. In Saginaw we heard about Black men who were leaning Trump or were
fully supporting his candidacy. Immigration and stimulus checks were two of the reasons why. The
former ? well you wouldn?t think that would resonate much up in Michigan and the latter is never
going to happen again (so long as we don?t have another once-in-a-century pandemic fingers
crossed!)
In one sense that?s an opportunity for the Harris campaign on the messaging and outreach front as
they work to reverse Trump?s polling gains in that community. But it?s also a window into the
?why? which so many people are having a difficult time explaining.
What do voters expect from presidents on the economy?
WOLF: I tend to think we overstate how presidents affect the economy but you found instances in
which the president arguably made some difference. Biden and Democrats passed legislation tohelp kickstart a green-energy economy which contributed to the opening of the conversion of the
plant in Lordstown in the red state of Ohio to battery production. And yet the workers there lean
toward Trump. What do they expect from Trump if he?s reelected since Trump wants the US to
focus on oil production not electric-vehicle development?
MATTINGLY: It?s a huge open question for the folks working in these industries that much is clear.
Look to your point if Trump is back in the Oval Office he won?t be all powerful. Lawmakers from
both parties see the benefit of certain pillars of Biden?s climate investments. The CHIPS Act was
bipartisan.
The infrastructure law money is something a lot of GOP lawmakers have taken credit for on the back
end even though they were almost completely unified in opposition when it was making its way
through Congress.
Some of the biggest manufacturers in the country ? the kinds of CEOs that carry weight with Trump
and his team ? are deeply invested in this space as well. So of course is China.
That?s not to say the threat of a shift away isn?t real. The Biden-Harris team hasn?t just funneled
hundreds of billions of dollars to this sector. They?ve also sent a clear message to the market that
companies should dive in because the federal government will have their back. That carries a lot
more weight than people probably realize and in a Trump administration certainly doesn?t seem
like it would be maintained.
?Do they care about me??WOLF: On the other hand Biden and Harris kept tariffs from Trump?s first term largely in place
even as they criticize Trump for wanting to impose new across-the-board tariffs. Are voters out there
keeping track of the ins and outs of these debates?
MATTINGLY: With the usual caveat that voters are not monolithic I think I was probably surprised
by just how granular of a level the people we spoke with were on weighing certain policies. So that
was awesome ? the degree to which our conversations were exceedingly thoughtful and rich on that
front.
But in terms of who they vote for one of the people we spoke to in Saginaw put it in the simplest but
most clear-cut way.
?Do they care about me? That?s the question.?
That?s the question and that?s the battle underway between the campaigns.
People care about their communities
WOLF: You have a story that features a Harris-supporting farmer holding signs on the roadside in
Trump country. I liked that one in part because it may be surprising that there are committed
Democrats in a red county or Republicans in a blue city but it shouldn?t be. There will be more
people who vote for Trump in California than Texas for instance. How were people getting along
with each other in the towns you visited?
Video Ad Feedback In a deep red corner of Pennsylvania this farmer is the face of the Trump

get flipped off or yelled at every third or fourth car that passed by and never took it personally.
Definitely handled that kind of thing better than I could!
Look the backdrop of all of this is something I always try to remember when I?m on the road for a
story. Regardless of party people ? every one of them ? has just come through a profoundly
disruptive and traumatic period in their lives. The political world in which we live has only
exacerbated that experience. Communities on their face at least reflect that when you talk politics.
But I also think constantly about a through line I?ve found every time I work on something like this.
People care deeply about those same communities. They care deeply about their families. They
desperately want their kids or grandkids to have the opportunities they either had or wish they had.
They want to embody the story of success or resilience or a comeback.
That?s not a partisan view. That?s universal. I?m not naïve and I lost any semblance of
rose-colored glasses about politics long ago.

26,Liberal,CNN,"Why working-class White women could be so decisive this fall
CNN ?
There is one conspicuous weak spot in the formidable wall of support Vice President Kamala Harris
has built among female voters. And that opening may represent former President Donald Trump?s
best chance to tip the states that remain most likely to decide the razor-thin presidential race.
Even as Trump struggled with other groups of women in his 2016 and 2020 presidential races exit
polls and other analyses showed that he amassed a big lead each time among White women
without a college education.
Those working-class White women loom as a critical potentially even decisive factor in Trump?s
third White House bid. That?s partly because so many of them polls show are torn between
personal disdain for Trump and discontent with the results of Joe Biden?s presidency particularly
over inflation and the border.
But it?s also because these women are especially plentiful in the three former ?blue wall? states
that still constitute Harris? most likely path to an Electoral College victory: Michigan Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin. To win those states which she is barnstorming every day this week Harris doesn?t
have to win most of those women ? Democrats almost never do ? but she does need to remain
competitive with them.
?They are really tired of Trump and they?d really like to move on but they are also nervous about
moving on and they do think the economy was better for them under Trump? said Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake. As for Harris Lake said ?They like she would bring everybody together they
like her empathy. ? But they don?t feel that they know her that well.? The sum total of thesecontradictory impulses is that ?They are really torn? Lake said. ?They feel very insecure about
these choices.?
One measure of how much Democrats prioritize these blue-collar White women is the massive voter
contact program that American Bridge 21st Century a party super PAC is targeting at them. The
group is spending about $140 million to try to reach 3 million women predominantly White women
without a college degree just in Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin the three states that Trump
in 2016 knocked out of what I termed the ?blue wall.?

Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
?In general the blue wall states are still the path of least resistance to 270? for Harris said Bradley
Beychok a co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century. ?But I think it?s pretty clear that women
are the determinative demographic of this election cycle and they have been the last few election
cycles so it?s not rocket science.?
American Bridge has pursued these blue-collar women through an extraordinarily long engagement
that began in 2023 by regularly mailing them newspapers produced by an affiliated group. The effort
has included multiple rounds of contacts and testimonial ads from former Trump voters delivered
through every available platform from television and digital to mail and streaming services. Beychok
said one of the group?s strongest messages is reminding voters of the uncertainty and volatility that
comes with Trump.
?If you show folks gee you put this guy back in the White House and you?ll have a sense of unrest
and disorder in your community ? people say ?I don?t want that?? Beychok said. Similarly headded ?If Donald Trump is proud that he made good on his threat to ban abortion and overthrow
Roe v. Wade and you know he?s an agent of chaos then what [rights] will? he threaten next?
Beychok said the group?s guiding principle is that even small gains with these women can prove
decisive across narrowly divided states. ?We may not get to 50.1 with them but if we run a program
to get what is available to us ? it can be just as effective? he said.
In fact winning a majority of these women has not been a realistic goal for Democrats. In exit polls
dating to 1980 the only Democratic presidential nominee who carried even a plurality of White
women without a college degree on a national basis was Bill Clinton in 1996. Democrats stayed
close among these women again in the razor-thin 2000 race between George W. Bush and Al Gore.
But while White women with a college degree have trended toward the Democrats in the presidential
campaigns since then the White women without a college degree have moved sharply in the
opposite direction.
The Republican presidential nominees won just under three-fifths of these working-class White
women in the 2004 2008 and 2012 races while Trump pushed his share with them over three-fifths
in both the 2016 and 2020 races according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a
consortium of media organizations including CNN. Other well-respected analyses of the 2016 and
2020 vote likewise showed Trump winning about three-fifths of these women with the Democratic
targeting firm Catalist putting Trump just below that threshold each time and the Pew Research
Center?s Validated Voters study putting Trump just underneath it in 2016 and just above it in 2020.
Supporters of former President Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally on October 9 2024 in
Reading Pennsylvania. Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe GOP advantage in those national figures is inflated by its imposing advantage among these
women in Southern states where many of them are culturally conservative evangelical Christians
who support the GOP in overwhelming numbers.
Critically for Democrats in the pivotal battlegrounds of Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin they
have usually run a few points better with these women than they do nationally. In Barack Obama?s
2012 reelection victory for instance he only won about one-third of these women nationally but he
carried about 45% of them in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and won a narrow majority of them in
Wisconsin the exit polls found. By contrast in 2016 Hillary Clinton the exit polls found stalled out
at around 40% support from them in all three states which contributed to her losing Michigan
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of roughly 80000 votes ? and with them the
presidency.
Compared with Clinton in 2016 Biden in 2020 posted a small but critical improvement among these
women in Michigan and Wisconsin contributing to his victories there exit polls found. Biden ran only
about as well as Clinton did with them in Pennsylvania where he flipped the state primarily by vastly
expanding on her margin in the heavily college-educated suburbs of Philadelphia.
Working-class White women in the former blue wall states may be even more central to Harris? fate
than they were to Biden?s. Even most Democrats acknowledge Harris may struggle to fully match
Biden?s showing among almost all the major groups of male voters especially White men without a
college degree as well as Black Latino and younger men.
Because Biden won Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by a combined margin of nearly
260000 votes Harris has a cushion to sustain some erosion among men. But Lake like many other
Democrats believes that to win the three big Rust Belt battlegrounds ? and for that matter any ofthe swing states ? Harris will likely need to run at least slightly better than Biden did among women.
?She is going to have to do better with women? Lake said flatly. ?She has to make up for the fact
that she won?t do as well with the men as he did.?
Polls show Harris has a good chance at improving over Biden?s 2020 performance with one group
of women in all of the battlegrounds including the former blue wall states: White women with at least
a four-year college degree.
In the 2022 midterm ? the first election held after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional
right to abortion ? the Democratic gubernatorial nominees in Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
all ran notably better among these women than Biden had two years earlier. Recent surveys by
Quinnipiac University showed Harris also drawing about two-thirds of these college-educated White
women in all three of the former blue wall states as did a recent Wisconsin poll by the Marquette
Law School.
Harris? position is less certain among women of color. Many polls have shown her facing some
decline compared with 2020 among both Black and Latino women but Democrats feel more
confident about her ability to regain most of that ground than they do about her odds of undoing the
shortfall with minority men especially Latinos.
That leaves the working-class White women as the biggest wild card among female voters. ?They
are weighing a lot of things? said Republican pollster Christine Matthews. ?They could very well be
deliberating up until the very last minute.?
Their choices will be especially important in the former blue wall states because the blue-collar
White women are so numerous there.In a new analysis shared exclusively with me William Frey a demographer at the nonpartisan
Brookings Metro think tank has calculated that these White women without a college degree will
comprise a huge share of eligible voters in these pivotal states. According to his analysis of the
latest census data they will represent over one-fourth of adults eligible to vote in both Michigan and
Wisconsin and almost exactly one-fourth in Pennsylvania. In all three states he found they
represent roughly as big a share of the eligible voting population as the blue-collar White men who
are Trump?s strongest group and a bigger group of eligible voters than either White men or women
with a college degree or non-White men or women. Every vote from every group of course counts
the same but the blue-collar White women are a big enough bloc that even minuscule shifts in their
preference or turnout could easily tip these precariously balanced states.
One word from Trump?s speech during a recent Wisconsin rally offers the best window on how he is
pursuing these working-class White women. Talking about undocumented migrants he declared
?They will walk into your kitchen they?ll cut your throat.? Trump didn?t say immigrants would walk
through the front door or into the living room. He specifically said they would come into a kitchen
where many women particularly in working-class households can easily envision themselves alone
and vulnerable.

October 6 2024 in Juneau Wisconsin. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP
That was just one salvo in the barrage of messaging from Trump and his allies ? in speeches and in
advertising ? that seeks to simultaneously trigger fears of crime from undocumented immigrants
portray Harris as too weak and too liberal to protect people from it and to present himself as the
strongman in all senses of that word who can provide that protection.Jackie Payne is the founder and executive director of Galvanize Action a liberal group that studies
moderate White women primarily those without college degrees. She acknowledges that Trump?s
alarms have resonated among working-class White women especially older ones. These women
she said ?express some of the fear around the border crisis; safety and security of their family is a
top priority and they identify the border crisis as a threat.?
But at the same time Payne said for many of these women the vehemence and vitriol of Trump?s
attacks on immigrants ? the dehumanizing language and lurid accusations ? is also triggering their
greatest concern about him: that he?s too divisive disruptive and chaotic.
Trump Payne said is ?making the bet? that voters fearful about their safety will accept language
and threats from him about immigrants that they consider ?ugly? if they believe such vehemence to
be ? the price of strength and protection.? But she added ?At the same time we see a revulsion
and disgust at the way we are talking about other humans.?
Trump?s other big asset with these women is the economy. Many working-class White women live
with very little economic margin and pollsters agree the cumulative increase under Biden in the cost
of living ? notwithstanding inflation?s decline over recent months ? has almost eclipsed any of his
other economic accomplishments such as the strong job market. ?If you are just getting by and
living paycheck to paycheck that increase in basic groceries did a number on you and you are very
focused on the economy? said GOP pollster Jon McHenry.
McHenry said in his polling significantly more of these blue-collar women say they were doing better
economically under Trump than Biden. The latest national New York Times/Siena survey reinforces
that finding: Among White women without a college degree 54% said Trump?s policies had helpedthem personally while a nearly identical 53% said Biden?s policies had hurt them according to
unpublished results provided by Siena. These women may feel a stronger personal connection with
Harris than they did with Biden McHenry noted but poll results such as those make clear they
don?t believe ?that things are magically better because Joe Biden withdrew from the election. They
are still feeling the effects of inflation; they are still not happy about the border.?
College-educated White women don?t give Biden?s policies great ratings in the Times/Siena poll
either. But both Mathews and Payne point out that?s almost irrelevant to the decision for most of
them: Trump himself provides the motivation for their vote. ?When I look at White college women I
see them as motivated by choice abortion and defeating Donald Trump? said Matthews. ?They are
negatively motivated by him; they want him gone.?
In the 2022 exit polls a solid majority of blue-collar White women also backed abortion rights across
Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin according to results provided by the CNN polling unit. The
Democrats? problem is not that these women don?t support legal abortion; it?s that fewer of them
prioritize it as much as their female counterparts who are college-educated single or younger.
?For White non-college women even if they are offended by some of this stuff coming out of the
Trump and Vance campaigns the misogynistic comments they are really focused on being able to
feed a family of four on their income? Matthews said. ?They are cross-pressured and they don?t
like what they are hearing. But they think he would do better on the economy and prices would go
down and that is the most pressing and relevant issue.?
In one of her campaign?s most notable achievements Harris has become more competitive on
economic issues; even if more voters still say they trust Trump to handle the macro-economy she?s
narrowed the gap in multiple polls on questions such as holding down costs or who cares aboutpeople like me. Her recent media offensive seemed aimed above all at buttressing those
perceptions: across the many podcasts town halls and talk show appearances the most powerful
through line in her message seemed to be to say to women: I have lived your life so I understand
what public policy must do to make it easier and more secure ? with everything from a restored child
tax credit to Medicare coverage for home health care for more seniors.
Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris hold up signs during a campaign event in Wilkes-Barre
Pennsylvania on September 13 2024. Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
Payne said the key for Harris is to ?at least draw even on ?you can trust me to deliver for your
family.?? If she can do that Payne said more working-class women will feel comfortable voting for
?a vision of America that they want to raise their kids in. They don?t want conflict they don?t like
the polarization and division.?
The toughest question for Democrats is how Harris? gender may affect the decisions of these
working-class White women across the Rust Belt. To this day some Democrats believe one key
reason Clinton narrowly lost the former blue wall states in 2016 was that too many of these women
remained uneasy with a female president particularly around issues of security.
In polling this fall Payne?s group found that Trump holds a big lead over Harris among White
women who score high on what social scientists call ?internalized sexism? ? a tendency to defer to
men ? while Harris held a commanding lead among those who scored low on that measure.
A recent national Gallup Poll points in a similar direction. White women without a college degree
were far more likely to identify Trump than Harris as a strong leader and someone who would
display good judgment in a crisis according to unpublished results provided by Gallup. Not onlycollege-educated White women but also the equivalent White men were much more likely than the
blue-collar White women to express positive views about Harris and negative ones about Trump
Gallup found.

27,Liberal,MSNBC,"After debate debacle Kari Lake?s campaign limps to the finish line
When all is said and done Kari Lake just might surpass Blake Masters and Martha McSally as
having run the worst campaign in Arizona political history.
The earlier campaigns were certainly cursed by their candidates? abject weirdness off-putting
demeanors and revulsion from fellow Republicans. But when it comes to electoral mishaps Lake
takes the cake.
Wednesday?s Senate debate in Phoenix was an opportunity to turn things around a bit. Sure recent
polling data has been quite unkind to her. Sure many local Republicans have defected to back Rep.
Ruben Gallego her Democratic opponent. Sure powerful GOP fundraising groups seem to have
abandoned her campaign in crunch time in favor of other races. Sure she has suffered public
embarrassment at the hands of Donald Trump?s own campaign.
But the debate gave Lake a chance to tee off on Gallego ? a chance to slime and slander him in
person just as she has been doing online and in interviews for the past year.
And she whiffed.
Among the most memorable moments from the debate was when Lake while defending the
Republican Party?s assault on reproductive choice repeatedly referred to IVF or in vitro fertilization
as ?UVF.?
Another notable clip features Lake refusing to acknowledge the fact that she lost the 2022
gubernatorial race in Arizona.If Republicans at the state and national level entered the debate with some skepticism it?s hard to
imagine they feel any more confident after this performance. And it was the only debate Lake and
Gallego have scheduled so with early voting underway the lasting image Lake left with voters ? on
the largest platform she?ll have had this cycle ? is one of a deranged and self-obsessed conspiracy
theorist who?s ignorant about one of the most significant issues in politics: reproductive rights.
I suppose anything is possible and Lake can still win. Gallego after all made a puzzling political
calculation that I wrote about recently. But less than a month from Election Day the Lake campaign
is clearly limping to the finish line.","MSNBC_After_debate_debacle,_Kari_Lake’s_campaign_limps_t.pdf.pdf",news_articles
28,Liberal,MSNBC,"Anti-trans attack ads haven?t won the GOP anything. Dems should
stop acting scared.
Vice President Kamala Harris was asked directly about trans people on Wednesday for the first time
this campaign season when Fox News? Bret Baier questioned her about a 2019 statement in which
she said she supported using taxpayer dollars for gender-affirming care for people who are
incarcerated.
?I will follow the law and it?s a law that Donald Trump actually followed? she said. ?These
surgeries are available to on a medical necessity basis people in the federal prison system.? In
mentioning Trump she was referring to a New York Times article on Wednesday that said former
President Donald Trump?s administration had provided gender-affirming care to incarcerated
people. Trump has been running fearmongering ads attacking Harris for supporting such a policy.
She was referring to a New York Times article that said Trump?s administration?s provided
gender-affirming care to incarcerated people.
When Baier again pressed her on the issue Harris went back to Trump whom she said ?spent $20
million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in
this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people.? She continued: ?Twenty
million dollars on that ad on an issue that as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American
people is really quite remote.?
It may end up being the last one of Harris? rare mentions of trans people this campaign. At this
year?s Democratic National Convention only two speakers even used the word ?trans? and
Democrats in general have been reluctant to defend trans people and their rights as Republicans
have been spending millions of dollars on ads whipping up anti-trans resentment.In two close U.S. Senate races Democrats Sherrod Brown who?s running for re-election in Ohio
and Rep. Colin Allred who?s looking to unseat incumbent Ted Cruz in Texas have not inspired
trans folks that they?ll have our back.
Allred who?s been attacked by Cruz for voting against a 2023 Republican bill requiring that sports
participation be based on birth sex responded with a short ad that begins: ?Ted Cruz is lying again.
But now he?s lying about our children. I?m a dad. I?m also a Christian. My faith has taught me that
all kids are God?s kids. So let me be clear: I don?t want boys playing girls sports or any of this
ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying. Ted Cruz is lying about my record because he can?t defend
his own.?
With the words ?I don?t want boys playing girls? sports? is Allred agreeing with Cruz that
transgender girls are boys? Or is the former NFL linebacker trying to play it both ways with phrasing
that lets him plausibly deny that he opposed the participation of trans girls? However he meant it
it?s being interpreted by trans people (and probably by anti-trans people too) as him opposing the
participation of trans girls in sports.
I?m a dad. I?m also a Christian. My faith has taught me that all kids are God?s kids. So let me be
clear: I don?t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.
REP. COLIN ALLRED IN A CAMPAIGN AD
In Ohio an ad from the Senate Leadership Fund Senate Republicans' political action committee
says ?Brown backed Biden voting to let biological transgender men participate in women?s sports
and supported allowing puberty blocker and sex-change surgeries for minors.? Brown?s response
has been to run an ad that in reference to trans girls in sports says ?In Ohio this has already beenbanned.? The ad says Brown agrees with Republican Gov. Mike Dewine that ?these decisions
should be made by local sports leagues not politicians.? Brown?s ad includes a news segment from
a fact-checking journalist who says that a claim by GOP Senate nominee Bernie Moreno that Brown
?voted to let transgender biological men participate in women?s sports is false.?
Though Brown?s ad doesn?t take a position against trans girls participating in sports ? as Allred
suggests when he says he?s against ?boys playing girls sports? ? his ad does suggest that he
won?t fight for trans participation in sports as he apparently believes politicians should have no say
in the matter. He says transgender girls have ?already been banned? from playing in girls' sports in
Ohio but notably he doesn?t say that it?s wrong that they were banned.
On top of that the Brown ad?s uncritical use of the language ?transgender biological men? in
?women?s sports? suggests an acceptance of the premise that trans girls are not girls. It may seem
like a sensible political strategy given how radioactive the polling is about trans athletes; but
characterizing trans girls as boys in a sports context would lead one to characterize them as such in
other contexts too.
After all if trans girls are really boys when they?re playing sports then they would also be
considered boys in the bathroom boys in medical offices and thus denied access to female
hormones. If trans girls are boys when they?re playing sports then trans women should be
considered men in all contexts.
Contrary to the assertion from conservatives that their aim is to protect the integrity of sports
competition their focus on the trans athlete issue has never really been about fairness. The goal
has been to establish a precedent that leads to the complete marginalization of trans women and
girls.It?s worrying to see Democrats running for Senate seemingly turn on trans people.
Left unsaid by both Senate candidates is what these ads mean for their previous support of the
Equality Act. Allred co-sponsored the Equality Act in 2023 and voted for it when it passed the House
in 2021. Brown co-sponsored the Senate version of the act in 2023. Neither bill came up for a full
vote in their respective chambers last year. The Equality Act as written would guarantee equal
rights for trans people under federal civil rights law. That includes educational opportunities like
scholastic and collegiate sports.
It?s worrying to see Democrats running for Senate seemingly turn on trans people. This election is
causing us enough stress already. As a community we understand that Trump returning to the
White House and Republicans having control of Congress would be a complete disaster for trans
progress but even more threatening to our rights would be Democrats abandoning the fight.
We intimately understand that the only thing standing between us and the GOP desire to ?purge
gender ideology from society? are Democrats so the prospect of liberals abandoning us has loomed
large throughout this campaign season.
Harris? answer to Baier was milquetoast but it provided a marginal bit of relief as did comments
from her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz who in an appearance on the ""We Can Do Hard
Things"" podcast pointed out that Republicans are leaning into attacking trans people:
?We see it now; the hate has shifted to the trans community. They see that as an opportunity. If
you?re watching any sporting events right now you see that Donald Trump?s closing arguments are
to demonize a group of people for being who they are? Walz said. ?We?re out there trying to makethe case that access to health care a clean environment manufacturing jobs and keeping your local
hospital open are what people are really concerned about. They?re running millions of dollars of ads
demonizing folks who are just trying to live their lives.?
For Harris? part she pledged to follow the law which currently requires the government to provide
gender-affirming care in a variety of contexts including to people confined to federal prisons. But
laws can change and she didn?t commit to defending that policy if there?s an attempt to change it.
Will she fight back if a Trump judge decides that incarcerated people shouldn?t receive such care?
Will our rights be a legislative priority under a Harris White House?
We simply don?t know.
They?re running millions of dollars of ads demonizing folks who are just trying to live their lives.
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE TIM WALZ
Transphobia has historically been an election loser for Republicans dating to 2016 when then-North
Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory who had signed the now-infamous trans bathroom bill lost in a red
wave election. In the 2022 midterms conservative groups spent millions on anti-trans ads only to
get wiped out at the ballot box. But Democrats have inexplicably avoided a fight over trans issues
this year.
A few weeks ago an unnamed Harris adviser speaking to NBC News expressed admiration for the
effectiveness of Trump?s anti-trans ad if not the content by describing it as ?a killer ad.? The
Washington Examiner reported last month that the Harris campaign had consulted the U.K. Labour
Party for strategy help. That?s the party responsible for banning puberty blockers for all trans youth
in Britain. Neither the comment from Harris? adviser nor the reported consultation with the LabourParty inspires confidence in me as a trans person and voter who depends on Democrats for my
rights in this country.
What makes the Democrats? seeming capitulation worse is that there?s little evidence that any of
the anti-trans ads are breaking through with voters. Polling shows that trans issues are of little
importance except to a tiny handful of voters. Harris said as much in her Fox News interview but
Brown and Allred (who've previously supported the Equality Act) responded to the GOP ad blitz by
softening their public support for trans rights in states where trans youths have been borderline
tortured by GOP policies.
I worry that Democrats or Harris losing next month will not only result in a disastrous Trump policy
for trans people but that Democratic consultants will pin those hypothetical losses on Democrats?
support for trans issues.
Democratic silence in the face of all-out Republican attacks on trans people already sends signals of
softening support for our community. The presidential polls have been tightening lately as happens
in most elections in October but that?s not the fault of trans people or the result of Trump?s
transphobic ads.
Trans people like me await the outcome of this election with dread as we dream of the day we have
a party that's willing to fight on our behalf and that will neither stay silent nor concede ground as the
conservatives carry out their reckless hate campaign.",MSNBC_Anti-trans_attack_ads_haven’t_won_the_GOP_anything.pdf.pdf,news_articles
29,Liberal,MSNBC,"A key GOP Senate candidate faces new ?carpetbagger? accusations
A variety of Republican U.S. Senate candidates this year have faced credible questions about their
connections to the states they?re running in. In Wisconsin for example Eric Hovde has lived in
California on-and-off since 2012. In Pennsylvania hopeful David McCormick has been credibly
accused of living in Connecticut. In Montana Democrats have been eager to remind locals that Tim
Sheehy is relatively new to the state having moved there from Minnesota.
Politico looking ahead to the 2024 cycle wrote last year ?A number of 2024 Senate candidates in
competitive races have a carpetbagger problem? and there?s ample evidence to bolster the point.
But perhaps no one in Republican politics is struggling with the issue more than former Rep. Mike
Rogers.
To be sure the former congressman was definitely born in Michigan went to school in Michigan
lived in Michigan and represented a district in the central part of the state for several years before
retiring from Capitol Hill a decade ago.
And then he did what a lot of retirees do: Rogers moved to Florida. We know this for certain
because he?s said so out loud and on the record. In fact the Republican who reportedly
purchased a very expensive home in the Sunshine State was still registered to vote in Florida as
recently as this year.
But according to the former GOP lawmaker Rogers has returned to the Wolverine State and is
ready to serve Michigan as a U.S. senator.
At first blush it?s reasonable to wonder whether and to what extent voters will care but for nowthat line of inquiry is secondary to a related and unexpected question: Where exactly does Rogers
live?
The Detroit Free Press? M.L. Elrick looked into the matter and explained in his latest column ?I
don?t know where Mike Rogers lives but it?s not where he?s registered to vote.?
Rogers the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate changed his voter registration on July 2 to a home
in White Lake Township that is under construction. A month later he used the White Lake address
to vote (presumably for himself) in the four-way race for the GOP nomination to replace retiring U.S.
Sen. Debbie Stabenow. There?s just one problem: The house did not ? and still does not ? have a
certificate of occupancy. That means Rogers could not live there legally. And if he didn?t live there
he may have broken the law by using that address to vote.
Before changing his registration in July Rogers apparently listed his brother's address as his own
though locals suggested they never saw him and he never lived there.
Elrick explored all of this in considerable detail ? his column is well worth your time ? and it?s worth
noting that the candidate?s spokesperson appears to have confirmed that Rogers as a result of
construction delays does not live in the house where he?s registered to vote.
Time will tell what becomes of this story though it?s probably fair to say the GOP nominee doesn?t
need this headache with less than a month remaining before Election Day: Most recent polling has
found Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin leading Rogers in a state that has elected a Republican
senator only once in the past 50 years. Watch this space.",MSNBC_A_key_GOP_Senate_candidate_faces_new_‘carpetbagger.pdf.pdf,news_articles
30,Liberal,MSNBC,"Democrats aren't ready to give up on Texas and Florida yet
Democrats can look at Florida and Texas in a couple of ways. From one angle the states are both
places where victory has been just out of reach ? a tantalizing ?what if?? From another they offer
an unlearned lesson in heartbreak a constant loop of Lucy yanking the football away from Charlie
Brown at the last second.
For now the former point of view is winning out as Senate Democrats look to hold on to their slim
majority. A new wave of money and interest has begun to pour into Florida and Texas as polls show
tightening races and Election Day fast approaches. And with incumbents like Republican Sens. Rick
Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas as their targets it?s not hard to see why Democrats see
going on the offense as a risk worth taking.
With incumbents like Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas as their targets
it?s not hard to see why Democrats see going on the offense as a risk worth taking.
The electoral map was never a good one for Senate Democrats this cycle forced to defend far more
seats than their Republican counterparts. With the GOP set to claim a seat from retiring Sen. Joe
Manchin I-W.Va. the upper house is already starting from a 50-50 split. The odds for Sen. Jon
Tester D-Mont. pulling off an upset in his now deep-red state have continued to narrow forcing
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. to look elsewhere for a path to a majority. And that
road requires knocking off at least one of the two least likable members of the GOP caucus.
Things are looking tight in Texas again this time around with Democratic Rep. Colin Allred closing in
on Cruz. Most polls still have Cruz ahead by around 3 points but an outlier run by Morning Consult
had the congressman up by 1 point. That?s still within the margin of error but the numbers have
galvanized Democrats? hope that the state might be a jump ball. Accordingly the Cook PoliticalReport shifted the rating in that race from ?likely Republican? to ?lean Republican? on Tuesday
reflecting Allred?s momentum.
Cruz at least is extremely aware of his own vulnerability. He roared into the Senate in 2012 and
quickly made a name for himself as a darling of the far-right tea party movement. But his bid for
president in 2016 faltered and his first re-election bid in 2018 ended up a squeaker that he won by
less than 3 points. In the last two years as he?s prepared to face voters again Cruz has sought to
refashion himself as a bipartisan moderate a hard task when you?ve built your whole brand on
being a provocateur and ideological bomb-thrower.
Scott on the other hand hasn?t bothered following Cruz?s lead in playing for the middle (despite
winning his seat that same year by just 0.1 points). Instead the first-term senator is angling to
replace Sen. Mitch McConnell R-Ky. at the top of the GOP caucus and take the title of majority
leader if all goes according to plan. But his time at the head of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee during the most recent midterms wasn?t exactly a wild success nor was his bid to
pounce against McConnell last year.
Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell isn?t faring quite as well against Scott as Allred is against
Cruz but she is gaining traction. Five Thirty Eight?s polling average has Scott up by 4 points which
is half of the lead he held over the summer. Mucarsel-Powell has also been set on making the race
into a referendum on reproductive rights. In doing so she?s hoping to draw enough support from
the abortion amendment on the ballot to negate any benefit Scott could get from riding former
President Donald Trump?s coattails.
The two biggest unknowns in these races are factors outside of the individual candidates? control:
infrastructure and demographics.The optimistic view is that each contest could be won with either more dedicated discipline from
local Democrats or greater resources and attention from the national party. But recent history has
shown that neither is a guarantee of success. Cruz?s challenger in 2018 former Rep. Beto
O?Rourke was popular both locally and nationally seen as a real contender at finally winning a
statewide race in Texas after a more than 20-year drought for Democrats. Likewise former Rep. Val
Demings D-Fla. transformed her race in 2022 against Sen. Marco Rubio into a national referendum
on the GOP but neither managed to unseat their opponent.
Those two races raised ? and spent ? a jaw-dropping amount of money in the process. O?Rourke?s
campaign drew in a staggering $80 million the most a single U.S. Senate candidate has ever
raised. Demings managed to raise almost as much for her race considerably outspending Rubio in
the process. This year the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced in late
September that both Mucasal-Powell and Allred will get support in the form of a multimillion-dollar ad
buy in their states but the DSCC has yet to disclose exactly how much is going to each candidate.
The two biggest unknowns in these races are factors outside of the individual candidates? control:
infrastructure and demographics.
Florida was once the biggest swing state in the country but has shifted to the right in the last
decade producing blowout wins for the GOP in the 2022 midterms. It doesn?t help that the
Democratic Party there has been a bit of a mess if we?re being honest which has left a vacuum for
Trump to fill in his new home state. And Scott who has already spent $8 million of his own money in
this race is sure to keep shoveling in cash to offset the DSCC?s investment.
Conversely Texas is deep Republican territory that Democrats have spent the last decade trying totransform into a purple state. An influx of people into the Austin and Houston metro areas has come
with a boost in liberal voters. A major question mark hovers over how the state?s Latinos wind up
voting this year as the GOP has been making major inroads with border communities. Meanwhile
Texas? Republican attorney general has been cracking down on voting rights potentially alienating
Latinos in the process.
With less than four weeks to go this is not an ideal scenario for Democrats. There?s plenty of
reason for cynicism in the face of these odds and so many prior disappointments. But with this much
on the line there?s little choice but to square up and take a running start at that football again.

31,Liberal,MSNBC,"Dems take a newfound interest in Ted Cruz?s and Rick Scott?s races
It?s not exactly a secret that Senate Democrats are on the defensive this election cycle. The party
currently has a one-seat majority in the chamber but with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West
Virginia Republicans have for all intents and purposes already flipped one seat.
As we discussed last week to secure a majority Republicans will need to win only one additional
seat which is hardly unrealistic: Democrats are having to fight tooth and nail to hold on to
competitive seats in Montana Ohio Nevada Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania Arizona and
Maryland. To have a chance of a 50-50 split in the Senate Democrats would have to win literally all
of those races some of which are being held in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win
easily.
And so the party is on the defensive. But what if the map could grow? The conventional wisdom
suggests every incumbent Senate Republican is all but certain to win re-election but what if the
conventional wisdom is wrong?
The Washington Post reported over the weekend that a ?small but vocal number? of Senate
Democrats believe the party is leaving potential pickup opportunities on the table and are ?pushing
party leaders and political operatives to pour money into trying to knock off GOP incumbents.?
And not just any Republican incumbents.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has finite resources and it doesn?t want to see
any of the party?s incumbents lose due to lack of investment. That said Axios reported that
Democratic leaders are telling their party?s biggest donors that their perspective is evolving.... Democrats are signaling they want to expand the playing field and be in a position to steal
Republican seats in states like Florida. Yes it?s still red but former President Trump isn?t expected
to win by double digits. They are also eyeing Texas where a recent poll has Sen. Ted Cruz
(R-Texas) up by three points against Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas).
This isn?t just scuttlebutt from unnamed partisan operatives: Michigan Sen. Gary Peters the current
chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee confirmed to Axios this week that the
races in Florida and Texas ?are real and we hope to get resources into those states.?
The report added that airtime hasn?t yet been officially booked in the race against Rick Scott
though ?Democratic sources tell us they expect the DSCC to make a splash in Florida in the coming
weeks.?
All things considered it?d be overstating matters to describe the Senate races in Texas and Florida
as among the nation?s most competitive but this shift in focus isn?t rooted in pie-in-the-sky
optimism.
Revisiting our recent coverage Cruz barely won a second term in 2018 and this year Rep. Colin
Allred looks like a candidate with plenty of crossover appeal. It was against this backdrop that Chris
LaCivita a senior campaign adviser for Donald Trump wrote via social media two weeks ago
?What the hell is wrong with the Senate race in Texas??
LaCivita added that as far as he?s concerned it?s ?time to get some real professionals in to save?
Cruz. Implicit in the message of course is that Cruz needs saving.
Meanwhile Florida?s Scott ? who has won three statewide campaigns by incredibly narrow margins? last month started dumping quite a bit of his own money into his re-election campaign. What?s
more a handful of recent statewide polls have shown former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell trailing
the far-right incumbent by 5 points or less raising Democratic hopes of a possible upset.
In case that weren?t quite enough there?s Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska a Republican who was
widely seen as a shoo-in for re-election ? up until very recently.
There is no Democratic nominee in the race but independent Dan Osborn ? best known for having
led a labor strike at a Kellogg?s plant in 2021 ? appears to be faring better than expected.
How do I know that for sure? In part because of fresh polling showing Osborn within striking
distance and in part because Republicans are starting to target Osborn with attack ads and if he
weren?t picking up support they wouldn?t bother spending money in one of the nation?s reddest
states.

32,Liberal,MSNBC,"Election Day is less than three weeks away ? it's going to feel a little
weird now
Three weeks from Wednesday every eligible ballot in the 2024 presidential election will have been
cast. Election officials will have worked long into the night across the country to tabulate millions of
votes. By the morning of Nov. 6 we may finally have an answer to the question those of us who
work in or around politics have received constantly for months: ?Who?s going to win??
It?s unfortunately the one question that nobody can answer with any certainty. There is no clear
outcome in sight. There are no debates waiting ahead for Vice President Kamala Harris and former
President Donald Trump to share a stage. And there are no major events to circle on the calendar
before the polls open. There is only a seeming eternity ahead for a race that lacks any clear favorite.
The uncertainty makes these few remaining weeks particularly maddening amplifying the smallest
potential shift as monumental while leaving little room for the race to be fundamentally altered.
It?s unfortunately the one question that nobody can answer with any certainty.
In the 1970s Japanese engineer researcher Masahiro Moti noted that ?in climbing toward the goal
of making robots appear human our affinity for them increases until we come to a valley which I call
the uncanny valley.? The things that rest in this valley can cause a feeling of deep unease distress
and dismay as our minds struggle to categorize something that comes close to but falls short of
appearing human.I?ve come to see this October as the uncanny valley of the election cycle. Stuck
between the dynamism of the summer and the surety of November Americans scour for anything to
break the tension. The elusive ?October Surprise? has accordingly gone from an event that nobody
could see coming to a quadrennial prediction that has more often fallen flat as pundits and politicos
hunt for something ? anything ? to shake up the race.Unfortunately the main balm that we all turn to in these moments isn?t as curative as we may want.
The latest national poll from NBC News shows Harris and Trump in a ?dead heat? with 48% each
from registered voters and a margin of error of ±3.1%. On the surface that seems like a major
problem when polling in September showed Harris with a 6-point lead over Trump and the same
margin of error.In practice though the margin of error means those two poll results aren?t as far
apart than they seem. Furthermore these snapshots are our best guesses of how people within a
pool of respondents feel right now but they aren?t the predictors that people want them to be. The
usefulness of frantically refreshing polling averages is roughly the same as staring into an empty
teacup looking for a sign among the leaves.
Polls showing a stable race after Harris caught up then passed Trump once President Joe Biden
dropped out should be a comfort to Democrats. But panic is a tried-and-true part of Democratic
identity even when an electoral landslide is just around the corner. These final weeks are always a
time of second-guessing when the candidate?s every choice up to that point is re-adjudicated and
every sign is a red flag of impending disaster.
Unlike the campaigns of her predecessors Harris? campaign has played out on a condensed
timeline and with that compression comes greater heat and intensity. And so a billion dollars raised
since Harris jumped into the race transforms into a potentially worrying sign that donors might not
provide needed cash in the final sprint. Decisions on where to spend time and what message to
send while there whom to sit with for interviews how resources are distributed among allies all
become fodder for speculation about why Harris may lose.
Harris? campaign has played out on a condensed timeline and with that compression comes
greater heat and intensity.The sheer amount of noise generated trying to make sense of everything becomes a problem in
itself. We?re awash in a sea of opinions that are telling Harris she needs to change up her strategy
in various contradictory ways before it?s too late. These last few weeks are just enough time to turn
a ship as big as a presidential campaign at least in theory to focus on the One Big Thing that will
secure a win. In an election this close though there are so many different variables to try to solve
for that it can feel impossible to find a formula that denies Trump an electoral victory.The resulting
calculus sees Harris? campaign desperately trying to put together a coalition that can remain stable
for the next 21 days. How do you both win back Black men who are open to Trump?s ham-fisted
appeals while also being relatable to the Never Trump Republicans you?re wooing? How do you
persuade progressives to turn out despite their hesitance over American support for Israel?s war in
Gaza while also focusing on slowing inflation and driving down consumer prices?
I?ll let you in on a professional secret here: I don?t have an answer to those questions. Even the
people doing the work of trying to win this election don?t know for sure. These next three weeks are
set to be a period of distinct discomfort as we stare into the unknown. There is no quick fix that will
calm the vibes and reassure nervous Democrats. Instead the most powerful thing we can do with
an uncomfortable feeling is to acknowledge its sources and work toward the changes we wish to
see.",MSNBC_Election_Day_is_less_than_three_weeks_away_—_it_s_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
33,Liberal,MSNBC,"Gen Z could decide the 2024 election. Here's what they're saying
about Harris and Trump
Veteran pollster Frank Luntz joined ""Morning Joe"" on Friday to discuss findings from a recent focus
group he held with undecided Gen Z voters.
Luntz shared that after watching the first ? and likely only ?presidential debate between Donald
Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris he assumed a gap would open up in the polling between
the two candidates.
""I had thought that Trump's debate performance would disqualify him"" Luntz said. ""I thought looking
at the two candidates side by side which the American people had been waiting weeks and months
to see that just as Biden's performance cost him the nomination Trump's performance would cost
him the election.""
However that wasn't the case: Polls show Harris and Trump remain in a statistical dead heat.
""I had thought that Trump's debate performance would disqualify him.""
Since the presidential race remains so close ? especially in the seven battleground states that will
likely decide the election ? Luntz said undecided voters will be essential to either candidate's path to
victory particularly young undecided voters.
""Make no mistake we are on a pin's edge right now and the essential key point of this is that who
they vote for is the next president of the United States"" Lunz told the ""Morning Joe"" panel.
According to one young voter Chris from Florida Trump's debate performance did impact how heplans to vote in November.
""I think I'm gonna vote for Kamala Harris"" Chris said. ""I just can't get over what happened in 2020
and what's been reaffirmed in the debates and the general statements made during the campaign.""
""It's not just the riot but the alternative slate of electors scheme is a bridge too far for me"" he went
on to explain.
Another participant Angelo from New York said he was previously leaning toward Harris but is now
floating the idea of writing another candidate's name on the ballot.
""The more I look back into it the more I watch the debate the more I look into her campaign I just

don't know if I can vote for Harris.""
That wasn't the case for Ayshah from Iowa who told Luntz that if the election were held today she
would cast her ballot for Harris.
""I just want to see what she will do because I know she's gonna have to run again later"" she said.
""So I'm hoping she will be an exemplary president for this term.""
Abigail from Virginia said the discussion with her fellow Gen Z voters influenced her to look further
into both candidates. However she also expressed hesitancy in supporting Trump due to his actions
in the days and months after the 2020 election.
?Trump if he wants to win needs to say less"" Luntz suggested. ""If Harris wants to win she needsto say more.""
""Some people said some things tonight that motivated me to do a bit more research"" Abigail told
Luntz. ""But the thing is I do not want to vote for someone I do not want to tell my children I voted
for someone that threatened democracy.""
""I need to analyze and think a little more before I just vote for Trump"" she said.
Reflecting on his conversation with the group Luntz offered advice to both campaigns on how they
can appeal to Gen Z voters in the closing weeks of the election:
?Trump if he wants to win needs to say less"" Luntz suggested. ""If Harris wants to win she needs
to say more. They don?t like who Trump is but they agree with him on inflation and immigration.
They do like what Harris represents but they still feel like she hasn?t been sufficiently forthcoming.""
?If she loses it?s going to be because she didn?t answer the questions that voters had wanted her
to answer"" Luntz said. ""And if he wins it?s because he finally realized he needs to say less not
more.?",MSNBC_Gen_Z_could_decide_the_2024_election._Here_s_what_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
34,Liberal,MSNBC,"Harris pushes health care into spotlight seizing on Trump?s
?concepts?
It?s been a few weeks since The New York Times reported on the ?absence? of health care as a
?top issue? in this year?s election cycle. ?In nearly every major presidential race for decades health
care has been a central issue? the Times? report added concluding that health care has become
?a second-tier issue.?
Vice President Kamala Harris appears determined to drag health care into the first tier whether
Republicans like it or not. NBC News reported:
Kamala Harris is launching a seven-figure ad blitz about health care targeting Donald Trump?s calls
to replace the Affordable Care Act with a mystery plan he hasn?t yet released. The ad campaign
first reported by NBC News is aimed at elevating the issue and capitalizing on what polling says is a
weakness for Trump.?
The minute-long commercial is built in part on the former president declaring at the recent
presidential debate that he has ?concepts of a plan? that would replace the nation?s existing health
care system.
The unveiling of the ad comes one day after the Democratic presidential campaign released a
43-page report on what Americans could expect from a second Trump term specifically on health
care policy based on his record his recent vows and the work members of his team have done on
the Project 2025 agenda.
Team Harris made the case that if the Republican nominee won?t release a health care plan
Democrats would take the liberty of filling in the gaps effectively presenting Trump?s plan for him.This week?s push comes on the heels of a series of related efforts including Team Harris
organizing dozens of public events with health care advocates in key states shining a light on the
GOP?s regressive vision.
Fortunately for the Democratic ticket and its allies their Republican counterparts have helped to
elevate the issue in unexpected ways. It was after all just two weeks ago when Trump?s
controversial running mate Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio shared new details about his plans
to weaken protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions ? creating a new opportunity for
Democrats in the process.
His running mate has helped too: Over the last several months the former president has repeatedly
targeted ?Obamacare? in increasingly explicit terms and as recently as December the Republican
nominee posted a video to his social media platform attacking the late Sen. John McCain for not
helping him ?terminate? the ACA in 2017.
I?m mindful of the broader election season conversation and the degree to which health care has
not enjoyed the national spotlight at least not on par with the economy and border security. But with
35 days remaining in the cycle there?s no reason the conversation can?t change.
In a new press statement the Harris campaign pointed to the latest national Gallup poll which found
two-thirds of Americans said health care needed to be discussed more as part of this year?s
elections. Surprisingly the results weren?t altogether partisan: A majority of Democrats
Republicans and independent voters all agreed that health care hasn?t gotten enough attention.
With this in mind Democrats appear eager to give the electorate what it apparently wants focusingon an issue on which Republicans struggle badly.

35,Liberal,MSNBC,"Harris visits Black church in Georgia in ?souls to the polls? early
voting push | CNN Politics
CNN ?
Vice President Kamala Harris visited churches in Georgia on Sunday urging congregants to cast
early ballots as part of her campaign?s ?souls to the polls? push to turn out Black voters.
The early voting push comes as Harris attempts to motivate Black voters who are a critical part of
the Democratic base. Her Republican rival former President Donald Trump has targeted those
voters ? hoping to chip into Harris? margins especially with Black men.
?Our country is at a crossroads and where we go from here is up to us as Americans and as people
of faith? Harris said at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest.
?We face this question: What kind of country do we want to live in?? she said. ?A country of chaos
fear and hate or a country of freedom compassion and justice??
Black churches have played a critical role in mobilizing Black voters since the Civil Rights Movement
? and Democratic campaigns have long sought to reach those voters particularly in early voting
states like Georgia where polls were open Sunday afternoon.
Despite holding an advantage over Trump among Black voters Harris has fallen short in most
polling of President Joe Biden?s numbers with the demographic when he won in 2020. In recent
weeks her campaign has made targeted media appearances and unveiled proposals aimed at
Black men in a bid to strengthen her coalition.In an interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC that aired later Sunday Harris dismissed the
notion that her support among Black men is lagging when asked whether she believes resistance
from some male voters is misogynistic.
?There?s this narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not
panning out in reality? she said referring to turnout at her rally in Atlanta on Saturday night.
?I will also say this Reverend: I am very clear I must earn ? earn the vote of everyone regardless of
their race or gender? Harris said. ?And what can be frustrating sometimes is to have journalists ask
me this question as though one should assume that I would just be able to take for granted the vote
of Black men. I think that?s actually an uninformed perspective because why would Black men be
any different than any other demographic of voter? They expect that you earn their vote.?
The vice president?s campaign?s ?souls to the polls? effort launched earlier this month with a
board consisting of Black faith leaders from around the United States also saw Harris? running
mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attend service at Victorious Believers Ministries in Saginaw
Michigan on Sunday.
At Harris? church visits she stressed the importance of voting. ?We have to remind people the
power they have in spite of those that would try to diminish and make people feel powerless in spite
of those who would try and suggest that ?Oh if you vote nothing will happen?? she said at Divine
Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro.
?For sure if you don?t vote nothing will happen. I mean recently I was reminded Jimmy Carter
voted? Harris added. ?Seems to me everybody can vote.?A spokesperson for the Carter Center confirmed to CNN last week that the former president who
recently turned 100 and had said he hoped to live long enough to vote for Harris ? cast his ballot.
Without naming her Republican rival Harris referenced the contrast ?on the other side? as she
outlined the stakes of the election.
?You know we know in terms of the parable of the Good Samaritan that we have learned and
should live a life where in the face of a stranger we see a neighbor but that?s not what we see on
the other side of this equation in this election it is constantly about berating people and belittling
people and name calling? she said.
Legendary singer Stevie Wonder performed while the Jonesboro congregation joined him in singing
?Happy Birthday? to Harris who turned 60 on Sunday and said Wonder performing for her checked
off a big item on her bucket list.
Sunday?s earlier visit in Stonecrest was also attended by Opal Lee known as the ?Grandmother of
Juneteenth? for the 98-year-old?s decades-long campaign to make the day commemorating the
ending of slavery a federal holiday.
The vice president wore a black suit with a pink blouse in honor of the church?s ?pink day? aimed
at raising awareness of breast cancer and she highlighted her mother?s work as a breast cancer
researcher.
Harris said that growing up she often attended Sunday school and sang in the choir. She learned of
a ?loving God who asks us to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves and to defend
the rights of the poor and the needy? she said.?For me like for so many of us church is then a place of growth and belonging and community; a
place where we are reminded of the incredible power of faith and fellowship. And in moments of
difficulty and uncertainty when the way is not clear it is our faith that then guides us forward? Harris
said.
Trump on Sunday morning appeared on Fox News where he said his closing message in the final
stretch to Election Day on November 5 is focused on border security inflation and transgender
athletes.
?We?re a failing nation right now? Trump said. ?We?re failing at the borders. We?re failing with
inflation and the economy. We?re failing with all of this woke stuff like men playing in women?s
sports and transgender operations and all of these things that are just terrible for our country and we
just can?t let it happen.?
At a rally the night before however his closing pitch devolved into profane attacks and a lewd story
about the late golfer Arnold Palmer.
His running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance visited Kroll?s West sports bar in Green Bay Wisconsin on
Sunday ahead of a Packers game.
?Go Pack go Trump? Vance said after taking a swig of beer.

36,Liberal,MSNBC,"Harris? tough talk is allowing Trump to claim the ?antiwar? mantle
When Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with a U.S.-made bomb Vice President
Kamala Harris hailed the act as ?a measure of justice.? Now Harris? team struggles to defend
Israel?s devastating air strikes on Lebanon which have displaced hundreds of thousands. Former
President Donald Trump has called the war ?unacceptable.? Meanwhile Harris labels those who
like Trump want Ukraine to be willing to make concessions as part of a diplomatic settlement as
proponents of ?surrender.?
If Harris aims to be the only presidential candidate defending Israel and Ukraine she should stop. It
allows Trump to position himself as the peace candidate ? something many Americans especially
swing voters crave. A survey conducted by my colleagues at the Institute for Global Affairs provides
some examples.
Harris would be wise to prioritize ending the conflicts. She should say she wants the wars to end.
Fully two-thirds of Americans want the U.S. to push for a negotiated settlement to end Ukraine?s
war and in six battleground states independent voters were the most inclined to do so. And a
plurality of independents in these battleground states believe any military aid to Israel must be
conditioned on first reaching a cease-fire. (The margin of error for both national and battleground
state samples in the survey was 3.9%.)
Instead of continuing the current open-ended ?as long as it takes? approaches which have failed to
distinguish between American interests and those of Ukraine and Israel Harris would be wise to
prioritize ending the conflicts. She should say she wants the wars to end.
Nationally when asked what goals the U.S. should pursue independents joined Republicans inbeing 20% more likely than Democrats to prioritize de-escalation over other goals like restoring
Ukraine?s borders or deterring autocrats. Even among Democrats the avoidance of escalation
outweighs the pursuit of total victory or deterrence.
In the presidential debate Harris conjured an image of Vladimir Putin ?sitting in Kyiv with his eyes
on the rest of Europe ? starting with Poland.? This scenario however seems far-fetched to both
low-information undecided voters and high-information national security experts alike.
Her swift pivot to addressing ?the 800000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania? revealed
more about political math than geopolitical reality. I?m not above data-based politics; this whole
piece is based on poll numbers. But there?s a difference between understanding voter sentiment
and treating American voters of Polish descent like they?re living in Warsaw rather than West
Chester.
Our poll found that independents join Republicans in their skepticism of America?s support for
Ukraine?s maximalist war goals ? but they join Democrats in their skepticism of unconditional
support for Israel?s war effort. Most want to either end American support outright or tie military aid to
a cease-fire.
Unfortunately for Harris while she and Trump are seen nationally as equally likely to end these
wars our battleground state polling tells a different story. In these states Trump leads Harris 58% to
42% on the issue with a 3.9% margin of error.
2024 is proving different. Foreign policy has muscled its way into the forefront of voter concerns.
This gap extends to broader foreign policy perceptions too. More voters nationally ? but fewer inthese swing states ? see Harris as someone who advances America?s interests abroad or pursues
a foreign policy ?which benefits people like you.?
Some might say ?So what? Elections hinge on issues that hit closer to home ? jobs inflation
cultural flashpoints.? That?s usually true. Five years ago James Lindsay of the Council on Foreign
Relations told me ?Most Americans don?t spend a lot of their time thinking about the ways foreign
policy affects them even though it affects them in profound ways.?
But 2024 is proving different. Foreign policy has muscled its way into the forefront of voter concerns.
A recent Pew survey ranks it fourth among issues driving voters? decisions and Trump has the
edge over Harris.
Even if U.S. presidential campaigns aren?t always interested in geopolitics geopolitics is interested
in presidential campaigns. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a shrewd observer of
American politics has most likely made the calculation that President Joe Biden has little willingness
to publicly rebuke Israel?s dangerous escalation mere weeks before a presidential election.
Harris now has a decision to make. She could continue to let Netanyahu dictate the direction of this
war or she could use the leverage with Israel the U.S. has long neglected. She would do well to
heed the counsel of her advisers such as Rebecca Lissner and Philip Gordon who offer a sober
and strategic alternative to the threat-inflation and simplistic good guys-vs.-bad guys narratives that
are all too common in Washington. Harris? selection of Tim Walz as her running mate hints at a
willingness to buck foreign policy orthodoxies. This is a start but she needs to go further.
Harris has an opportunity to articulate a new vision of foreign policy that?s both principled and
pragmatic. One that recognizes the limits of American power without abandoning its ideals and seesthe risks as well as the rewards of its security partnerships and alliances. Historically successful
presidential candidates often run against wars. George W. Bush campaigned against nation-building
before embracing it. Barack Obama?s opposition to the Iraq War was instrumental to his rise.
Trump?s ?America First? rhetoric resonated deeply in 2016.
For Harris calling for the end to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine wouldn?t be just smart policy ? it
would be smart politics.",MSNBC_Harris’_tough_talk_is_allowing_Trump_to_claim_the_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
37,Liberal,MSNBC,"In key Senate race Montana?s Sheehy faces overlapping messes
The U.S. Senate is up for grabs in the 2024 election cycle and it?s far from clear which party will be
in the majority for the next two years. It?s likely that the entire national effort will come down to a
contest in one state: Montana.
Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent running on a
record of success and it won?t hurt his chances that there?s an abortion rights ballot measure on
the statewide ballot. At the same time however Montana has earned a reputation as a reliably red
state where Donald Trump will almost certainly win easily.
Candidate quality however still matters in competitive races ? and in Big Sky Country the
Republican candidate keeps running into trouble. NBC News reported:
Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy who is locked in a highly consequential race with
Democratic incumbent Jon Tester said in newly unearthed audio that the Republican Party needs to
do a better job at winning over young women who he said have been ?indoctrinated? for years on
the issue of abortion.
?Young people listen up they?ve been indoctrinated for too long. We don?t even try to talk to them
anymore? Sheehy said at an event in late 2023 according to audio obtained by NBC News.
In case that weren?t quite enough the Republican went on to say ?It?s called murder. That is the
position of the American Democrat [sic] Party.?
Tester?s spokesperson responded to Sheehy?s rhetoric saying ?Tim Sheehy calling young women
?indoctrinated? because they value reproductive freedom just goes to show how out of touch he iswith Montanans. In Montana we don?t want the government telling us what to do ? and Sheehy?s
position that politicians should get the final say over our health care is one of the many ways he?s
trying to change Montana for the worse.?
This is probably the sort of story the GOP candidate would prefer to avoid four weeks before
Election Day but complicating matters for Sheehy is that this is the latest in a series of overlapping
messes.
The Republican Senate hopeful for example has also used racist rhetoric when talking about
Native Americans ? which is indefensible under any circumstances and which is especially foolish
in a state with a sizable Native population.
There?s also the lingering controversy surrounding Sheehy?s gunshot wound which he admits to
having lied about and which he refuses to explain in more detail.
Unfortunately for the GOP candidate the list keeps going. For example Sheehy has also been
accused of plagiarism. He?s also been accused of doctoring footage in a campaign commercial to
obscure his association with a group that has advocated in support of transferring public lands
which is a big issue in Montana.
In August NBC News reported that Sheehy?s claims about success in the private sector aren?t
quite what they appear to be.
CNN reported last week meanwhile that the Republican ? a 38-year-old political novice who?s
never held elected office ? has also ?gone to extreme lengths to avoid press scrutiny? during his
campaign.With all of this in mind a casual observer might assume that Tester is trouncing Sheehy. That?s not
the case: The latest polling suggests the challenger is actually leading the incumbent.
There?s no great mystery as to why: Sheehy has an ?R? after his name in a red state. That?s it.
That?s the whole explanation.
But if Tester manages to outperform the polls and hang onto his seat for another term expect a
whole lot of ?candidate quality? conversations in GOP circles in the weeks and months following
Election Day.","MSNBC_In_key_Senate_race,_Montana’s_Sheehy_faces_overlap.pdf.pdf",news_articles
38,Liberal,MSNBC,"In N.C. Trump takes a chance pretending his FEMA lies are true
Communities across the Southeast most notably in North Carolina have spent the last several
weeks trying to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath. It was against this backdrop that
Donald Trump visited the Tar Heel State two weeks ago and pursued a radical idea: Maybe the
former president said he could advance his own interests by brazenly lying about the governmental
response to the deadly storm.
State and local officials including plenty of Republicans asked him to stop deceiving the public but
he ignored the appeals ? even as evidence emerged that Trump?s lies were having an adverse
impact on the response to the crisis.
It was by some measures a genuine election-season scandal: The GOP nominee for the nation?s
highest office saw devastated communities and human suffering which inspired Trump to
repeatedly lie about the heartbreaking circumstances hoping it would advance his quest for power.
Two weeks later he did it again. NBC News reported that the former president returned to North
Carolina where he ?again made the false claim that FEMA had no money to help victims in the
hurricane-stricken area because it was spending funds on migrants.?
As he?s done for weeks Trump appeared to conflate two completely separate funds to paint a
misleading picture. FEMA has dedicated disaster relief money that cannot be used for other
purposes and it was separately tasked by Congress in 2022 to disseminate money from Customs
and Border Protection to help communities that received influxes of migrants.
?They spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants. ... They don?t have any money for the
people who live here? Trump said despite reality. ?They?ve spent it on illegal migrants.?He was of course lying ? or more to the point he was echoing previous lies which he knows have
been discredited but which he continued to repeat in the hopes that it?ll benefit him personally.
Reminded that these and related conspiratorial lives have led to threats against FEMA workers in
the area Trump expressed relative indifference. ?I think you have to let people know how they?re
doing? he told reporters. ?If they?re doing a poor job are we not supposed to say it??
I?m not in a position to say whether Trump actually believes his lies or whether he knows he?s
peddling nonsense. But either way the consequences of his dangerous lies are the same.
To be sure I?m mindful of the broader circumstances: North Carolina is a highly competitive
battleground state and the latest polling suggests he?s effectively tied with Vice President Kamala
Harris in the state. It?s hardly surprising that the Republican has concluded that he?ll say whatever
he has to say regardless of accuracy or propriety to get ahead.
But there is a risk of a backlash. If you?re an on-the-fence North Carolinian unsure which candidate
to support and one candidate comes to your state to lie about the response to a deadly natural
disaster would you be more or less likely to vote for that candidate?
Trump could?ve simply made an appearance and expressed his support. He instead decided to
take a chance by peddling easily discredited nonsense.","MSNBC_In_N.C.,_Trump_takes_a_chance_pretending_his_FEMA_.pdf.pdf",news_articles
39,Liberal,MSNBC,"It?s time to put the Electoral Count Reform Act to the test
This article is the first in a five-part series called ?Protecting the Election.? As former President
Donald Trump and many of his allies refuse to concede his defeat in the 2020 election this MSNBC
Daily series brings election law and policy experts to explore the many threats to certifying election
results at both the state and national level.
Normally the period after an American presidential election is a time for cooling off and winding
down tensions and is often a bit of a political ?honeymoon? for the winner. But as in so many
things we are not living in an era of electoral normalcy.
Luckily we do have some new guardrails enacted in response to the attempts to overturn the 2020
election. The Electoral Count Reform Act (ECRA) signed into law in 2022 updates and shores up
many of the antiquated procedures from the old Electoral Count Act of 1887 which proved so
unhelpful in 2020. The 2024 election will be ECRA?s first test and it may well be a trial by fire. And
unlike the 2020 election the stress test might come from both sides of the aisle.
The Electoral Count Reform Act updates and shores up many of the antiquated procedures from the
old Electoral Count Act of 1887.
In deciding a possible dispute over the most powerful office in the world the rule of law is
paramount. The process of an American presidential election is intricate and complex with
thousands of state and federal officials having a role in the final outcome. But the legal parameters
of how any potential disputes will play out are reasonably clear and worth reviewing in advance.
When is Election Day?The first question answered by ECRA is deceptively simple: When is Election Day? As is tradition
this date remains set at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November which this year is Nov.
5. But as hurricanes and their aftermath continue to batter states in the Southeast the question of
an election-disrupting emergency is not entirely hypothetical. The same issue arises from the
possibility of a terrorist attack mass shooting or other disruption to polling places on Election Day.
ECRA provides an answer for how such emergencies can be fairly and lawfully handled.
Under the newly reformed federal law Election Day is defined as the usual date except that voting
may be extended ?as necessitated by force majeure events that are extraordinary and
catastrophic.? By qualifying election emergencies in this manner ECRA makes clear that litigation
or other legal disputes over a state?s administration of the election do not qualify. (Using force
majeure in this manner was a particular suggestion I?d advocated during ECRA?s drafting). Only
events outside of the state?s control such as a natural disaster are sufficient to extend the deadline
otherwise set according to Congress? constitutional power to determine the ?time of choosing
electors.?
As with most other matters under ECRA states must apply their election laws as they stood on
Election Day with no later alterations permitted such as by the legislature convened in a special
session. In each state a possible emergency invocation of these extended voting procedures is
assigned to a designated official who may be the governor secretary of state or a state elections
board. This rule also forecloses the idea advocated by some during the 2020 election of state
legislatures or other officials attempting to overturn the results of the state?s popular vote.
Counting the votes
The next step in the process is the counting of votes and the ascertainment of a winner in eachstate. Here ECRA provides a remedy intended to address problems not just from 2020 but also
from the notorious 2000 election. Instead of the usual cumbersome procedure for federal litigation
where lawsuits must be filed first in a district court and then appealed to one of the circuit courts
before finally reaching the Supreme Court a special three-judge panel is provided consisting of two
circuit judges and one district judge. This court?s rulings are then directly appealable to the
Supreme Court ensuring a prompt resolution of both legitimate legal objections and possible rogue
actions by state officials. If any state official refuses to comply the courts are empowered to order
another official to provide the necessary certifications.

Images file
It is this procedure that would come into play if for example a state?s governor refused to certify
the properly chosen members of the Electoral College or if a secretary of state refused to certify the
popular vote totals on which that certification depends. The final ?certificate of ascertainment? from
each state naming its electors must be finalized no later than Dec. 11 six days before the Electoral
College meets.
Once each state?s popular election result is finalized the state then appoints its members of the
Electoral College. These electors nominated by each party in advance meet in their respective
state capitals on Dec. 17 to officially cast the votes that will actually determine who has won the
election. In most states as upheld by the Supreme Court in the 2020 ruling Chiafalo v. Washington
these electors are bound by state law to vote for their party?s nominees. The candidate who wins an
absolute majority of the electoral votes currently 270 thereby becomes the president-elect.Changes to congressional certification
The next stage of the process comes when these votes are transmitted as required by the 12th
Amendment to the president of the Senate otherwise known as the vice president ? currently
Kamala Harris. She will not be the first vice president to preside over a certification of her own
victory or defeat a task previously carried out by Al Gore Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush
among others.
But contrary to theories rejected by then-Vice President Mike Pence in 2020 ECRA affirms that the
vice president?s role is purely ceremonial and entails no discretion whatsoever. Instead the limited
range of possible disputes at the electoral count on Jan. 6 must be decided by Congress.
ECRA deliberately pushes most possible disputes over election results into the courts.
Here ECRA makes an important change from the old Electoral Count Act. Previously only one
member of each house of Congress was required to object to electoral votes sending the matter to
a debate and vote. It was under this provision that some Republican members objected to the
electoral votes for Joe Biden in 2020 a procedure interrupted by the attack on the Capitol.
Now objections require the co-sponsorship of at least one-fifth of each house or at least 87
representatives together with at least 20 senators. None of the objections attempted at the last
electoral count would have cleared this threshold. Lacking enough support frivolous objections will
instead be gaveled down as out of order.
ECRA deliberately pushes most possible disputes over election results into the courts. In particular
objections to the identity of the proper electors based on who actually won each state?s popularvote are to be litigated in advance with a definitive court ruling then binding on Congress. This
would cover the objections advanced by Donald Trump supporters in the last election which
essentially alleged that the wrong slate of electors had been certified in several key swing states. No
longer will Congress play any role in deciding between competing slates of supposed electors and
only one legitimate slate?s votes will be presented during the joint session.
Another set of objections remains within Congress? purview as required by the Constitution. These
cover whether the votes by otherwise legitimate electors were improper or in the legal term of art
?regularly given.? This would include for example a hypothetical objection to electors? failure to
cast their votes on the prescribed day which the Constitution requires to be the same in every state.
It would also cover somewhat less hypothetically an objection that the votes were cast for an
ineligible presidential candidate.
It is on this point that objections from Democratic members of Congress are possible on the basis
that Trump is disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment a provision adopted after the
Civil War to bar oath-breaking insurrectionists.
Though the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that states may not kick Trump off the ballot on
this basis the question of whether he is actually disqualified remains for Congress to decide. This
objection might be raised to votes cast for him even if he has already lost and would require
majorities in both the House and Senate to sustain.
To the maximum degree consistent with the Constitution ECRA sought to put electoral disputes into
the courts rather than being decided by Congress.
Once Congress completes the electoral count on Jan. 6 the process is over and its results are finalexcept in the unlikely event that no candidate has won the necessary majority of 270 electoral votes.
In this scenario under the 12th Amendment a ?contingent election? would be held with the House
electing the president (under an unusual procedure where each state delegation casts one vote)
and the Senate would choose the vice president.
To the maximum degree consistent with the Constitution ECRA sought to put electoral disputes into
the courts rather than being decided by Congress. Any arguments over which candidate and thus
which party?s slate of electors has won a state?s popular vote is to be decided in federal court prior
to when the Electoral College meets in December. In all cases state law as it stands on Election
Day is decisive and states may not change the rules after the fact.
Congress with the vice president presiding ceremonially but having no say in the matter is
empowered to address only a narrow set of questions about whether the otherwise valid electors
have cast their votes in a permissible manner under the Constitution such as for a candidate who is
not a natural-born citizen or who is not at least 35 years old. But the role of Congress will not be to
relitigate disputes over how each state conducted its election.
Once this process is complete ? state laws implementing a popular election for members of the
Electoral College courts deciding any disputes over the outcome of those elections the duly
appointed electors meeting and casting their votes and Congress counting the electoral votes ? the
winner will be sworn in at noon on Jan. 20 a date and time set in stone by the 20th Amendment.",MSNBC_It’s_time_to_put_the_Electoral_Count_Reform_Act_to.pdf.pdf,news_articles
40,Liberal,MSNBC,"I?m a Republican strategist. Here?s why I'm confident about Kamala
Harris? campaign.
There is no playbook for a three-month presidential campaign but if there were it would look like
what Vice President Kamala Harris has done so far.
Since she joined the race at the end of July Harris has raised record amounts of money including
enough to help Democrats down-ballot; whooped Donald Trump in their only debate; picked up
endorsements from some notable Republicans; developed a great volunteer network and expanded
the substantial ground operation she inherited from President Joe Biden.
But with the race in a dead heat that may not be enough.
The closeness of the race has led some Monday-morning quarterbacks to argue that the problem is
Harris has not done enough interviews. She has actually done quite a few including tough ones with
CNN's Dana Bash the National Association of Black Journalists and ""60 Minutes""; and less
hard-hitting ones with local news outlets in swing states and popular podcasts targeted at key
demographics such as Hispanics and young women.
Still this complaint has circulated enough through the news and social media the Harris campaign
has scheduled more national media interviews for her and her running mate Tim Walz who even
went on ""Fox News Sunday.""
It's possible that these interviews may help sway the sliver of undecided voters who are still looking
for a sign.
It's possible that these interviews may help sway the sliver of undecided voters who are still lookingfor a sign. At the least they may keep the pundits and pontificators at bay especially if they prove to
be uneventful. At a minimum it's another chance for Harris to get her message out in the final
weeks of the campaign.
But let's be clear: This is not how the race will be won. The campaign has internal polling that shows
much more than the publicly available polls what the head-to-head race looks like which voters are
still gettable and what messages are motivating them. It has behind-the-scenes efforts to reach out
to supporters by email text message social media phone calls and knocking on doors. And it has
millions of dollars in ads rolling out daily.
What the public and the press see of a campaign are just the tip of the iceberg. And in my 35 years
of experience as a strategist I've learned that things look much different on the inside. A campaign
is like a marriage; you never really know what's going on unless you're in it. And while I don't know
what it's like inside the Harris headquarters any more than the next pundit the way the campaign
has gone so far gives me confidence in how things are going there.

41,Liberal,MSNBC,"Kamala Harris' Fox News appearance is a lesson for Democrats
A net win
The debate over whether Democrats should engage with Fox News has been going on for years
but I?ve always argued in favor of showing up on the network. First of all refusing to engage gives
Fox News the story they want. Imagine if I had refused to call on Peter Doocy in the White House
press briefing room. I would have missed out on some of my most satisfying briefing room
exchanges and it would have implied I was somehow scared of his questions.
And as Vice President Kamala Harris proved during her interview Wednesday night Fox News is
really not that scary. Sure Harris? interview wasn?t perfect but she delivered a much stronger
answer on how her presidency would be different from Joe Biden?s and she very memorably called
out host Bret Baier for failing to play Trump?s full ?enemy from within? comments.
When I was White House press secretary I appeared on ?Fox News Sunday? more than any other
weekend news show. In part to prove I could. But also to help combat misinformation and present
Americans with arguments and data they may not otherwise see. Plus a combative interview can be
fun sometimes. Just ask Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
Ultimately refusing to engage with outlets like Fox doesn?t punish them. It?s the same reason why I
think Democrats who refuse to engage on social media platforms are making a big mistake. Yes
many platforms have legitimate flaws but they also provide more than 50 percent of people with
their news. With just weeks until Election Day now is not the time to try to claim the moral high
ground. Candidates need to meet voters wherever they get their information and leave nothing on
the field.A story you should be following: Judge stops Georgia State Election Board rules
In a much-needed win for voting rights Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox struck
down several new rules proposed by Georgia?s Trump-aligned State Election Board. These rules
widely condemned as attempts at voter suppression were deemed ?illegal unconstitutional and
void? by Cox in a scathing ruling.
The judge specifically condemned the Georgia State Election Board for ignoring current law and
proposing these reforms so close to Election Day. Referring to a rule requiring video surveillance of
drop boxes after polls close Cox wrote ?the S.E.B. cannot by rule require something the General
Assembly both did not legislate and specifically considered and declined to enact.?
While Republicans may still appeal the clock is obviously ticking. Courts have historically hesitated
to make sweeping changes this close to elections making this ruling a significant setback for
partisans attempting to undermine mail-in voting and chip away at election integrity.
A race to watch: Independent Dan Osborn vs. Republican Deb Fischer
At this point Democrats are fighting an uphill battle to maintain Senate control. But one potential
surprise could happen in Nebraska a state often assumed to be an easy Republican win.
Independent Dan Osborn a former union president who led his colleagues in the Kellogg?s strike in
2021 is taking on two-term Republican Sen. Deb Fischer and the numbers are getting very
interesting
This week Osborn?s campaign claimed it had crossed a critical threshold and was now polling
(according to their internal numbers) ahead of Fischer. The race has also become an unexpectedcash suck for Republicans who are now investing in new attack ads against Osborn.
Osborn has not announced who he will caucus with in the U.S. Senate but much like Sens. Joe
Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema he could easily be the key Senate swing vote to watch.",MSNBC_Kamala_Harris__Fox_News_appearance_is_a_lesson_for.pdf.pdf,news_articles
42,Liberal,MSNBC,"Kamala Harris? press tour was a missed opportunity
It wasn?t the best week for the Vice President Kamala Harris media tour what with Hurricane Milton
bearing down on Florida Israel preparing a potentially massive strike on Iran and the Oct. 7
anniversary which brought both solemn commemorations and furious protests to cities and
campuses across the United States.
The Harris campaign conducted this tour not because it had something new to say but because it
needed to redirect the media narrative about its candidate.
But with the presidential election only 25 days away her campaign did not have much more time to
respond to the persistent criticism that she was hiding from journalists and voters avoiding
unscripted exchanges and essentially trying to run the clock out like a team nervous about its
razor-thin lead. So there she was on ?60 Minutes? the ?Call Her Daddy? podcast drinking beer
with Stephen Colbert chatting with the ladies of ?The View? telling Howard Stern about her
exercise routine (elliptical machine in the morning while watching ?Morning Joe?).
And that is the problem: The Harris campaign conducted this tour not because it had something new
to say but because it needed to redirect the media narrative about its candidate.
?There is at times an impression that her campaign consists almost entirely of pivots? Alex
Shephard smartly observed in The New Republic earlier this week while a New York Times
headline said she ?Continues to Bob and Weave? in interviews. It all adds to the very mood the
press tour was supposed to dispel.
Take for example her exchange with Bill Whitaker of ?60 Minutes? about whether the United
States still has influence over Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister who could be pushingfor a wider Middle East war.
?We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where
we stand on the need for this war to end? Harris said. I have no idea what this means. Neither did
Whitaker who pressed her in a follow-up asking if we have ?a real close ally? in Netanyahu.
?The better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the
Israeli people. And the answer to that question is yes? Harris answered. She probably wanted to
say that Netanyahu is a jerk which everyone knows but that the United States is going to make
sure it can fend off existential threats from Hezbollah Hamas and Iran. But she didn?t want to upset
Jewish voters or Arab American and Muslim voters so she said nothing at all.
Later Whitaker ? the week?s best interviewer ? asked how she would pay for her economic plan
which he pointed out came with an estimated price tag of $3 trillion. Her answer included the bland
assertion that small businesses are ?part of the backbone of the economy.? OK and?
Because of the way the interview has been edited ? with voiceovers from Whitaker regularly
breaking in ? the Trump campaign is pushing CBS News to release a full unedited transcript of the
interview.
Voters who are mobilized by reproductive rights are already firmly in her camp.
As the media tour came to a close with a Univision town hall on Thursday night I was left with the
same vague impression I had before the press tour ? which makes that tour a massive missed
opportunity. There was no moment akin to Bill Clinton blowing the horn on ?The Arsenio Hall Show?
in 1992 nothing surprising or unexpected.Running out the clock may not be an option. ?Polls coming in show Harris peaked and interviews
not helping. Swing states trending away from Harris? veteran pollster Mark Penn wrote in a social
media post. ?It?s not over until it?s over and this is still on a razor?s edge so it can flip back but
that?s a fair read of newest polling.?
And in The New York Times the former Obama communications director Daniel Pfeiffer pointed out
that Trump is making critical inroads with younger men by appearing on nontraditional podcasts and
streaming shows. Pfeiffer observed that 13 million people watched Trump?s interview with
comedian Theo Von ?about twice the viewership of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?s much
ballyhooed interview with Dana Bash of CNN.?
Harris had a good conversation with Alex Cooper host of the massively popular ?Call Her Daddy?
podcast. Much of it focused on reproductive health with Harris pointing out that Roe v. Wade was
overturned by a Supreme Court with three Trump picks. And if he wins in November she warned
(correctly) that he may well have two more high court appointments which would turn the Supreme
Court into a right-wing fortress.
The problem is that the voters who are mobilized by reproductive rights are already firmly in her
camp and polls have shown the economy remains the top concern for swing voters.
Harris spent an hour with a strangely fanboyish Howard Stern ? who might be looking to atone for
his role in mainstreaming Trump over dozens of appearances between 1993 and 2015. Stern
described a potential second Trump term as a nightmare for democracy and Harris naturally
enough agreed. The problem here is that as with abortion the voters for whom a second Trump
term is unpalatable are already in Harris? camp.As for the swing voters? In a recent focus group of swing voters the democracy argument fell flat.
?Many of these Pennsylvania swing voters have grown skeptical of end-of-democracy warnings
and now suffer from ?Most-Consequential-Election Fatigue?? said moderator Rich Thau of
Engagious.
We do know that voters badly want change. They are unconvinced that the sitting vice president will
be that change agent (though it?s unclear how returning to a previous president is all that much
change either). During her appearance on ?The View? Harris was asked how she would have
governed differently in the last four years had it been she not Biden who were president.
?There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of ? and I?ve been a part of ? of the decisions that
have had impact? Harris mystifyingly responded.
Because I like beer I was amused to see Harris sipping a Miller High Life with Stephen Colbert. But
with Colbert (and most other late-night comedians) firmly in the anti-Trump camp does yet another
buddy-buddy interview move the needle in key battleground states?
For what it?s worth I still think Harris will squeak it out. But if she doesn?t her inability to fearlessly
say who she is and what she believes will be one of the reasons. And even if she does she will
likely face a Congress where both chambers are controlled by Republicans. There will be no
avoiding difficult conversations with GOP leaders who are going to be a lot less understanding than
Joy Behar.
During her interview with Stern the host expressed frustrated amusement at the state of the
presidential race. ?I don?t even understand how this election is close? he said. I read that as asubtle rebuke. As for the vice president she had no response.

43,Liberal,MSNBC,"Let's not sugarcoat it: Trump is running a textbook fascist campaign
This is an adapted excerpt from the Oct. 15 episode of ""All In with Chris Hayes.""
Eight decades ago the United States joined an alliance of nations in a world war to defeat fascism.
Millions of Americans fought and sacrificed for that war including the father and mother of retired
Gen. Mark Milley. In 2019 Milley would become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff the
top-ranking general in the U.S. military.
Decades after his parents? service Milley is offering a stark warning that fascism is taking hold
again not in Germany or Italy but here in America. According to Milley as reported by journalist Bob
Woodward in his forthcoming book the biggest threat to democracy and safety in the nation is its
45th president and the same man who wants to be the 47th president: Donald Trump:
He is the most dangerous person ever. I had suspicions when I talked to you about his mental
decline and so forth but now I realize he?s a total fascist. He is the most dangerous person to this
country?A fascist to the core!? Milley repeated to me. I will never forget the intensity of his worry.
Less than three weeks out from Election Day the former top general is warning America that it could
elect a fascist to be president. And he?s right: Trump is running a straightforwardly fascist
campaign.
It?s becoming harder to ignore as threats of violence and racism become a central feature of his
rhetoric and his rallies. It was on full display this week when Trump chose to hold a key rally not in a
battleground state but in the heart of blue Colorado in the Denver suburb of Aurora.
Aurora is where for weeks Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance have pushed a fakenarrative that the city is paralyzed by gangs of migrants. To be clear: It?s a bigoted lie. Every bit as
false and racist as Trump?s claims about Haitians in Springfield Ohio. And just like they did in
Springfield local Republicans including Aurora's Republican mayor are calling out Trump?s lies.
But that hasn?t stopped Trump and his campaign from using the city to make their disgusting
dishonest argument claiming America is ?under occupation? and needs ?liberating.? At the rally
Trump turned the fascism up to 11 amplifying the racist hatred of migrants and vowing to mobilize
the federal government to use violence against them.
If you think that you?re safe because you?re not a migrant and that Trump would never use that
power against you think again.
?Kamala has imported an army of illegal aliens and gang members and migrant criminals from the
dungeons of the Third World? Trump falsely claimed. ?I?m announcing today that upon taking
office we will have an Operation Aurora at the federal level to expedite the removal of these savage
gangs. And I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.?
Yes the Alien Enemies Act. Trump is promising to ?round up? migrants using a law passed under
John Adams which was designed to allow the president to arrest detain and deport ""aliens"" from
any country at war with the United States.
It was invoked by Woodrow Wilson to throw Germans out of the country in World War I and led to
the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. It is a disgusting stain on the
history of American pluralistic democracy and Trump wants to use it to round people up on
American streets.And if you think that you?re safe because you?re not a migrant and that Trump would never use that
power against you think again:
?I think the bigger problem are the people from within? Trump told Fox News on Sunday. ?We have
some very bad people. We have some sick people radical left lunatics ... and it should be easily
handled by if necessary by National Guard or if really necessary by the military because they
can?t let that happen.?
The textbook fascist idea is that if you resist you your neighbors and your family could be classified
as domestic enemies of the state more dangerous than a foreign adversary. This is the campaign
Trump is running for president. The only way it could be more fascist is if it painted Democrats as
unworthy moral degenerates.
Oh wait. The Trump campaign is doing exactly that running wall-to-wall ads in the swing states
accusing Harris of supporting ?taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens? and
telling Americans ?Kamala?s for they/them. President Trump is for you.? Trump is running that ad
because he believes fear and bigotry will win them the election.
This is a fascist campaign: It?s a war on truth and on the people who tell truths. It promises a violent
ultimate victory over every perceived enemy of Trump ? using the power of the state and invoking
the voice of the people.
And he?s running neck and neck in the polls with the sitting Democratic vice president. Why is that?
For one thing after decades of far-right media programming a lot of Americans are primed for an
authoritarian leader. Some portion of the country just affirmatively likes the strongman pitch. Ofcourse it rarely works out for them in the long run. Survivors of fascist regimes stand as evidence
that no supporter is safe from the regime they boost.
But the second and critical advantage that fascism has in America today is that the press still
doesn?t know how to fully communicate the perilousness of our situation ? in part because Trump is
the world?s most famous liar. He?s such a liar that even many of his biggest supporters simply think
he?ll never do the things he says. As one Republican pollster told The New York Times this week
?The normal rules just don?t apply to Donald Trump and you?ve seen it time and again.?
This is a fascist campaign: It?s a war on truth and on the people who tell truths.
That pollster said that his polling and focus groups indicated that ?people think he says things for
effect that he?s blustering because that?s part of what he does his shtick. They don?t believe that
it?s actually going to happen.?
But the question of whether you should take Trump seriously or not got a definitive answer in his last
weeks in office as he desperately attempted to cling to power.
In the lead-up to that election conservative columnist Ross Douthat wrote that ?there would be no
Trump coup? adding that Trump was ?a noisy weakling not a budding autocrat.?
Trump?s former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney wrote that ?If Trump loses he will concede gracefully
? He?ll fight hard to make sure the results are fair and in the end he?ll accept the result whatever it
is.?
We now know just how deadly wrong those assumptions were. Yet even as Trump ratchets up thefascist rhetoric we?re memory-holing what he did as president and living in denial of what he would
do if he became president again.",MSNBC_Let_s_not_sugarcoat_it_Trump_is_running_a_textbook.pdf.pdf,news_articles
44,Liberal,MSNBC,"On economic and business interests isn't the 2024 choice obvious?
It was just a couple of months ago when Donald Trump launched a bizarre offensive against Brian
Kemp Georgia?s incumbent Republican governor for no particular reason. The former president
slammed Kemp as a ?bad guy? ?disloyal? and ?Little Brian.?
At an event in the Peachtree State Trump also targeted the governor?s wife and goaded his
followers into booing their home state?s GOP governor. Perhaps most importantly the former
president singled out Kemp for failing to commit election fraud to benefit him in 2020.
Two months later Kemp explained why he?s supporting his party?s presidential nominee anyway.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported:
?Look you may not like Donald Trump personally but you?ll like his policies a lot better than
Kamala Harris?? Kemp said at a recent Republican gathering. ?It?s a business decision. You?re
making a business decision.?
This is a common refrain. The New Yorker?s Susan Glasser has a new report on wealthy
Republicans who?ve re-embraced Trump highlighting billionaire investor Nelson Peltz who
denounced Trump the day after the Jan. 6 attack. In an interview with CNBC Peltz apologized for
his vote and said that Trump would always be remembered for that day?s ?disgrace.?
?As an American? he added at the time ?I?m embarrassed.?
Now Peltz and many of his allies are nevertheless backing Trump again ? because like Kemp
they?re ?making a business decision.?Similarly The New York Times? Nate Cohn published a report this week on why the former
president is faring better in 2024 polling among Black and Hispanic voters despite his overt racism.
?Many people assume that Democrats win Black and Hispanic voters simply because of the party?s
commitment to advancing racial equality? Cohn wrote ?but the role of economic self-interest
should not be underestimated.?
A whole lot of folks in other words are simply ?making a business decision.?
But what if they?re asking the right question while coming to the wrong answer? Rachel had a great
A block on the subject this week and it?s worth reviewing the basic truths:
Inflation is where it was when Trump left office. Economic growth under the first three years of the
Biden-Harris administration we now know is higher than economic growth was under the first three
years of the Trump administration. ... Economic growth is up. Wages are up. Retail sales are good.
Interest rates are dropping. We are having record highs on Wall Street. Biden and Harris this
administration has produced the best job growth numbers of any presidential administration in
American history by a mile. Unemployment numbers are profoundly low and in a sustained way. It?s
the best unemployment figures that we have seen in decades.
In fact it was just a couple of weeks ago when The New York Times reported that the U.S. job
market ?is as healthy as it has ever been? ? as in in the history of the United States ? and
described recent economic growth as ?robust.?
A few days later The Washington Post?s Heather Long explained in a column that by ?just about
every measure the U.S. economy is in good shape. Growth is strong. Unemployment is low.
Inflation is back down. More important many Americans are getting sizable pay raises andmiddle-class wealth has surged to record levels. We are living through one of the best economic
years of many people?s lifetimes.?
The same day Politico described the status quo as ?a dream economy.? Soon after The
Economist described the U.S. economy as ?the envy of the world? adding that the American
economy ?has left other rich countries in the dust.?
And so maybe you?re willing to overlook the fact that Trump deployed a violent mob to attack his
own country?s Capitol because he didn?t like the election results. And you?re willing to look past
the fact that he?s currently awaiting sentencing after having been found guilty of 34 felonies. And
maybe it doesn?t matter to you that Trump is also awaiting trial on dozens of additional felony
charges (he?s pleaded not guilty).
And maybe you don?t care about the time he told Americans that disinfectant injections could treat
Covid about his family separation policy about his corrupt pardons his impeachment scandals his
racism or his authoritarian agenda.
Maybe you?re simply ?making a business decision.?
But in practice what does that mean? Under the Biden-Harris administration the U.S. economy
hasn?t just ?left other rich countries in the dust? it?s also left the Trump administration?s record in
the dust.
If your concern is about the deficit and fiscal issues Trump?s record is indefensible and his vision
for the near-future is even worse.If your concern is about inflation Trump?s economic agenda is rooted in policies that would
absolutely make inflation worse ? as economists keep trying to tell the people.
If your concern is about the candidates? business backgrounds Trump failed repeatedly in the
private sector and he?s been reduced to hawking a bunch of highly sketchy products.
If your concern is about how the candidates interact with business leaders Trump keeps having
special gatherings with corporate executives who tend to come away with the impression that the
Republican is utterly clueless.
If your concern is about the candidates? running mates Republican Sen. JD Vance has spoken
publicly about imposing ?pain? on businesses that fail to align with his party?s culture war agenda.
If your concern is about the candidates looking out for the business community Trump has recently
threatened a variety of corporate giants from John Deere to Google.
For those are who are simply ?making a business decision? this doesn?t seem like an especially
tough call.","MSNBC_On_economic_and_business_interests,_isn_t_the_2024.pdf.pdf",news_articles
45,Liberal,MSNBC,"Read the transcript of Kamala Harris? exclusive solo MSNBC
interview
This is a full transcript of the exclusive interview of Vice President Kamala Harris by MSNBC's ""11th
Hour"" host Stephanie Ruhle. It has been lightly edited for clarity.
RUHLE: Madam Vice President you just laid out your economic vision for the future.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: But still there are lots of Americans who don?t see themselves in your plans. For those
who say these policies aren?t for me what do you say to them?
HARRIS: Well if you are hardworking if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations
of what I believe you do you?re in my plan.
I have to tell you I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of
the American people. We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see
what?s possible. We have an incredible work ethic.
But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But
we don?t lack for those things. But not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. And so my
vision for the economy ? I call it an opportunity economy ? is about making sure that all Americans
wherever they start wherever they are have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those
ambitions which include for middle-class families just being able to know that their hard work
allows them to get ahead right?I think we can?t and we shouldn?t aspire to have an economy that just allows people to get by.
People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. And I come from the middle class.
Look my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a
teenager she was able to buy our first home. And homeownership for too many people in our
country now is elusive. You know gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the
American dream.
So part of my vision for the economy is let?s deal with some of the everyday challenges that people
face and address them with commonsense solutions such as affordable housing.
RUHLE: Over the last four years there have been tremendous economic wins. And you have just
laid out a big plan.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: But still polling shows that more -- most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to
handle the economy. Why do you think that is?
HARRIS: Well here?s what I know in terms of the facts.
Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression when you look at for
example the employment numbers.
RUHLE: It was during COVID and employment was so high because we shut down the
government we shut down the country.HARRIS: Even before the pandemic he lost manufacturing jobs by most people?s estimates at
least 200000. He lost manufacturing plants. Ask the autoworkers how he lost auto plants.
We have grown over 20 new auto plants. He has an agenda. Let?s just deal with it right now going
forward not to mention what happened in the past.
He has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime an
agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses an
agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20 percent more
on everyday necessities and an estimated $4000 more a year on those everyday necessities to the
point that top economists in our country from Nobel laureates to people at Moody?s and Goldman
Sachs have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy.
His would shrink the economy. Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase
inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So the facts remain that Donald Trump
has a history of taking care of very rich people.
And I?m not mad at anybody for being rich but they should pay their fair share ? but tax cuts for the
billionaires and the top corporations in our country and then not really paying much attention to
middle-class families. My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class
America?s economy is stronger.
And there?s empirical evidence to prove my point correct.
RUHLE: Then let me ask you about taxes because lots of people will say I don?t like DonaldTrump but he cut my taxes. He didn?t just cut corporate taxes. He cut individual taxes.
Now that expires next year. And there?s some people confused saying I don?t know what?s going
to happen next year.
Under a Harris administration at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up?
And that state and local tax deduction that?s currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue
states are you going to lift that cap?
HARRIS: So first of all when it relates to anybody making less than $400000 a year your taxes will
not go up. Your taxes will not go up. And in fact under my plan taxes for 100 million Americans will
actually be cut including $6000 a year for young couples for the first year of their child?s life in a
tax cut a tax credit essentially by expansion of the child tax credit.
And why is that? Because during the first year of a young couple ? of a person?s ? child?s life
they?re going to need help buying a crib buying a car seat. And we all benefit when they?re actually
able to do what they naturally want to do to take care of their child.
RUHLE: And expanding that child tax credit or you mentioned housing before giving that extra
money for a first home if you can?t raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the Senate
where do you get the money to do that?
Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow?
HARRIS: Well but we?re going to have to raise corporate taxes. And we?re going to have to raise ?
we?re going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share.That?s just it. It?s about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone for achieving success but
everyone should pay their fair share. And it is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I
meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country.
RUHLE: Bill Gates just said it this week. If he was in charge of taxes he would have paid more.
But how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share but they?re not
leaving our country?
HARRIS: Well listen I work with a lot of CEOs. I have spent a lot of time with CEOs.
And I?m going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America?s
economy agree that people should pay their fair share. They also agree that when we look at a plan
such as mine that is about investing in the middle class investing in new industries investing in
bringing down costs investing in entrepreneurs like small businesses that the overall economy is
stronger and everyone benefits.
Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active
partnership with the private sector. I have worked with the private sector my entire career. I ? even
as vice president working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase
by billions of dollars the money going into community banks to increase access to capital for small
businesses.
Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? Because they know those kinds of
investments like in our small businesses in start-ups and entrepreneurs actually strengthensAmerica?s economy overall and everyone benefits.
So this is not about bilking anybody but it is certainly about saying let?s make sure that we create
opportunities for everyone to grow wealth. I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our
goal to just make sure everyone is working. That should be the baseline. That should be a given.
And let?s create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home to start a business to
take a nice vacation from time to time right?
RUHLE: For people who want to buy a home yes getting a $25000 kicker would be great but it?s
not just affording a home. We don?t have enough in this country.
HARRIS: You?re absolutely right.
RUHLE: And one of the main problems are regulations and rules strict strict rules at a local level.
How does the federal government cut through all that red tape and get down to I don?t know the
suburbs of Pittsburgh and say we?re going to have to build some affordable housing here? How do
you connect the two?
HARRIS: So you?re absolutely right.
So across our country people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. So it?s
homeownership to your point. We need more supply. That is without any question part of the
solution.Creating more supply under my plan includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector
and homebuilders. Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units
for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term. It includes also what we must do to cut red
tape. You?re absolutely right.
It takes far too long and there?s too much bureaucracy associated with homebuilding. And I say that
as a devout public servant. I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need
to do around building. And that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local
governments.
And it?s going to be different in different places depending on the needs of that community the
needs of that local government that municipality but working in consultation and coordination and
also around incentives that we can create.
For example some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and
assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars and looking holistically at the
connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal
government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic
manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing for working people.
RUHLE: Then let me ask you a business that matters a lot to this town...
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: ... U.S. Steel.HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: Right? When you think Pennsylvania when you think Pittsburgh you have got the Liberty
Bell in Philly and you have got U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh.
HARRIS: That?s right.
RUHLE: A Japanese company wants to buy them.
HARRIS: Mm-hmm.
RUHLE: You are opposed to this idea. Many people are. But if the deal doesn?t go through they
have said people could lose jobs. They could close mills. They could leave the state of
Pennsylvania.
I mean that is like moving the Liberty Bell to Newark. So which is more important?
HARRIS: It?s most important that we maintain America?s ability to have American manufacturing of
steel by American workers for a number of reasons which includes again back to the point of
growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall investing in new industries.
There is not a new industry that I can imagine that is not going to require steel as a ? manufacturing
of steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes. And having American workers in an
American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically
important not only in terms of our economy but also in the context of national security.Most people now realize if we didn?t before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an
over-reliance on foreign manufacturing that we have to be intentional about U.S.-based
manufacturing. And of the products that we have to prioritize steel is one of them. And that?s
always going to be my priority.
RUHLE: Steelworkers matter in this country. Unions matter.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: In 2016 Donald Trump connected with unions. He saw them. He ? there was an emotional
connection. But what he didn?t do was deliver policy.
In the last four years we have seen huge wins in this country for unions but not all unions have
gotten behind you. I want to understand. When the Teamsters decided not to endorse you what
was their reasoning? What are they looking for?
HARRIS: Well let me go back to our just previous conversation. I?m very proud to have the
endorsement of the steelworkers and almost every other major union in America because I stand by
workers and I stand by the importance of being able to join a union and to understand the benefit
and the value of unions.
And I understand the importance of investing in new industries and working actively with the private
sector to grow our economy.
RUHLE: But I?m asking because there?s this idea we want something more from her. What is it?HARRIS: Well here?s the thing that ? back to your point about previous election cycles.
Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet and one would argue broke.
Look at Lordstown. He said he was going to...
RUHLE: Don?t sell your homes.
HARRIS: Yes don?t sell your homes.
And what happened? It shut down. Outsourcing under Donald Trump. His policies that are about
putting tens to hundreds of percent tariffs.
RUHLE: John Deere.
HARRIS: Yes. Yes.
So part of the challenge ? and I don?t disagree that it?s a challenge got to earn the vote of
everybody ? is reminding people of fact regardless of what somebody says in a small rally
somewhere. And I think that?s really important. And that?s part of what I?m doing in this campaign
is to remind people just like here in Pittsburgh of the reality of who has stood with union labor who
stands for American manufacturing who stands for American jobs.
RUHLE: Can I ask you about tariffs?
Because you just mentioned it. It?s not just with one company. Donald Trump?s sort of big idea is
this broad-based tariffs across the board. You and many others have said that would be not onlydisastrous but it would be a direct tax on the American consumer.
HARRIS: It would be a sales tax on the American people that ? the independent economists have
already measured this by his ? the sales tax of doing a 20 percent tariffs on all imports that he has
described would be a 20 percent sales tax in essence on basic necessities for the average
American worker average American family totaling almost $4000 a year.
That is no small matter. Here in Pittsburgh when I?m talking to a group of folks who work here who
live here and when they hear it might be $4000 more a year for them look people can?t afford
that.
RUHLE: But tariffs aren?t unique to President Trump. President Biden has tariffs in place. He?s
actually looking to potentially implement more. Where do you come out on is there a good tariff a
bad tariff?
HARRIS: Well part of it is you don?t just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board. And
that?s part of the problem with Donald Trump.
I ? frankly I?m going to ? and I say this in all sincerity. He?s just not very serious about how he
thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan and a real plan
that?s not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally but actually
putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment what will be the economic impact
on everyday people?
And when you look at my plans you will see what those benefits will be $25000 down payment
assistance for first-time homebuyers. You know what that means? Then you?re creating the abilityof that working person to build intergenerational wealth.
Doing the work of a $6000 child tax credit doing the work of a $50000 tax deduction for first-time
small businesses start-ups because right now...
RUHLE: That?s a real plan.
HARRIS: It?s a real plan because right now ? and again it?s about paying attention to the detail
and being serious about it.
I?m serious about my enthusiasm and my ? for small businesses and my belief in what they will do
as part of America?s economic engine. On Friday...
(CROSSTALK)
RUHLE: Oh sorry.
HARRIS: And also looking at the fact that right now the tax deduction is $5000. Nobody in this
Year of our Lord 2024 can start a small business with $5000. Very few can.
So extending it to $50000 tax deduction for start-ups to generate the innovation and the ambition
of the ideas that are present and among us but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal.
RUHLE: His plan is not serious when you lay it out like that but a serious problem over the last few
years has been inflation. Luckily it?s cooling but prices are still high.(CROSSTALK)
HARRIS: Yes I agree with you.
RUHLE: You have said you want to take this on by going after those who engage in price gouging.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: But as somebody who supports free markets who?s a capitalist how do you go after price
gouging without implementing price controls?
Because once we get in this zone people start to get worried and they say I don?t know what she
stands for.
HARRIS: So just to be very frank I am never going to apologize for going after companies and
corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people.
And as attorney general I saw this happen. In the midst of an emergency whether it be an extreme
weather event or even the pandemic we saw it where those few companies not the majority not
most but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up
prices.
Yes I?m going to go after them. Yes I?m going to go after them. And that is part of a much more
comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living including housing including
the everyday needs of the American people.RUHLE: On Friday you are going to the border.
Immigration is complicated. One of the issues is an economic one. And no one is eating cats and
dogs in Springfield Ohio. And I?m glad not to be talking about that. But there are people there that
are stressed that feel that they?re at capacity. Communities around the country that have legal
immigration many have said we?re at capacity.
And many feel like the government has said to them well adapt sit down be quiet this is how it is.
What would a Harris administration do for those communities who?ve taken in many many legal
immigrants but are at capacity?
HARRIS: Well first of all we do have a broken immigration system. And it needs to be fixed.
And if we take a step back months ago some of the most conservative members of the United
States Congress came together with others proposed a border security bill that would have put
1500 new border agents on the border to help those hardworking border agents who are there right
now working around the clock would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl
which is killing Americans around our country and devastating communities would have put more
resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations which in my career I
have prosecuted.
Donald Trump got word of the bill realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and
told them to kill the bill don?t put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a
solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.And that?s part of what needs to be addressed. And my pledge is that when elected president if
the American people will have me I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. And we need a
comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the
fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.
RUHLE: And I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job.
HARRIS: OK.
RUHLE: The first one just a fact-check.
HARRIS: OK.
RUHLE: Because your opponent almost every day...
HARRIS: There is no little job.
RUHLE: OK.
HARRIS: There is no such thing as a little job.
RUHLE: OK. Fair fair.
(LAUGHTER)
RUHLE: Because your opponent almost every day seems to be talking about this. So I just want toask you yes or no...
(CROSSTALK)
RUHLE: ... at any point in your life have you served two all-beef patties special sauce lettuce
cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun...
(LAUGHTER)
HARRIS: On a sesame seed bun?
RUHLE: ... working at McDonald?s yes or no? That?s it.
HARRIS: I have.
RUHLE: OK now the other job. Now the other one.
HARRIS: And -- but it was not a small job. Like I did fries.
RUHLE: OK.
HARRIS: I mean I -- you know.
(CROSSTALK)
HARRIS: But I did.(CROSSTALK)
RUHLE: ... time.
But then let me ask about a big job.
HARRIS: But to your point if you don?t mind before you get to the big job...
RUHLE: Please.
HARRIS: ... it?s a -- there?s a -- part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald?s
is because there are people who work at McDonald?s in our country who are trying to raise a family
-- I worked there as a student I was a kid -- who work there trying to raise families and pay rent on
that.
And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the
needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs.
RUHLE: Then to the big job.
You have laid out policy in great detail.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: But the economy is an unpredictable beast. And you are running for a job that takesextraordinary instinct and guts.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: When?s the last time you had to make a gut decision? This here is very prescribed. It?s
very controlled.
HARRIS: Yes.
Probably the biggest gut decision I have made most recently is to choose my running mate yes.
There were lots of good incredible candidates. And ultimately that came down to a gut decision.
RUHLE: I know I?m out of time but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut.
HARRIS: OK.
RUHLE: Because today we?re talking about reproductive -- excuse me -- we?re talking about the
economy.
HARRIS: Yes.
RUHLE: And people don?t think often about reproductive rights being an economic issue. But it is a
woman?s ability to plan her future her education her life.
Today and in the last few days Donald Trump keeps talking about it and how in overturning Roe v.
Wade he helped women he protected women. He says they?re miserable today. They?re poorertoday. They?re more vulnerable today. He said he will be the protector of women if elected.
Can you respond to that?
HARRIS: So Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a
decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future.
So I think we would all agree that as a result of that perspective that he has about women he also
then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended undid the
protections of Roe v. Wade.
And now in state after state you see laws being passed that do punish women laws that -- I mean
most recently a heartbreaking story resulted in a young woman dying a mother of a 6-year-old
heart-wrenching stories. And that?s for the listener much less their family.
So look I think the thing about Donald Trump is that I don?t think the women of America need him
to say he?s going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them.
RUHLE: Can we trust you?
HARRIS: Yes. Yes.
I am not perfect but I will tell you I?m always going to put the needs of the people first.
RUHLE: Madam Vice President thank you for your time today.HARRIS: Thank you. Thank you.",MSNBC_Read_the_transcript_of_Kamala_Harris’_exclusive_so.pdf.pdf,news_articles
46,Liberal,MSNBC,"Ted Cruz really could lose
There?s a reason no Democrat has accomplished a statewide victory in Texas since 1994.
Pulling off such an upset would require a uniquely talented politician running an almost perfect
campaign. That candidate would need to display discipline calm and poise. Be telegenic and quick
on the feet. The candidate would need to be thoroughly Texan and have an identity infused with
elements of the state?s cultural zeitgeist. The person would need to run in a halfway decent national
political environment. And even with all of those boxes checked that rare Democrat would still need
to square off against an extraordinarily disliked Republican running a lackluster campaign without
much support from the person's own colleagues.
Enter: Rep. Colin Allred.
An impressive debate performance alone is not enough for a Democrat to win a state like Texas.
Allred?s remarkable debate performance Tuesday spawned a flurry of Instagram slides TikTok
videos and X posts. Both in Texas and nationwide news feeds have been flush this week with clips
of the former professional football player rebuking Sen. Ted Cruz for hiding in a ?supply closet?
during the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol ? a riot by a mob that Cruz himself helped whip
up. Others showed him repeatedly referencing the time Cruz flew to Cancun Mexico as hundreds
of Texans died during the middle of a winter freeze or hammering him on his abortion stance ? an
issue critical to white female voters who have been abandoning the GOP in droves.
But an impressive debate performance alone is not enough for a Democrat to win a state like Texas.
However polls fundraising and a changing political climate have all looked promising for Allred.
Today Texas Democrats are in an extraordinary situation one that has proved elusive over the pastthree decades: They have an actual chance of winning a statewide race.
As of Thursday FiveThirtyEight?s average of polls had Cruz stuck at 48.4%. A Morning Consult
survey released Thursday showed Allred down by just 1 point. An internal memo from the Senate
Leadership Fund ? the Mitch McConnell-aligned super PAC focused on electing Republicans to the
Senate ? had Cruz up by only 1 point. A different polling memo released by the National Republican
Senatorial Committee omitted any information on the race. If the numbers were too bad to share
that?s certainly a worrying sign for Cruz.
Democrats have been hopeful about statewide races before but this time is different. In 2022 some
polls had Beto O?Rourke narrowly trailing Gov. Greg Abbott. But by the start of October Abbott was
consistently polling above 50% and in the end he beat O?Rourke by 9 points. Sen. John Cornyn
for much of his 2020 re-election bid was running neck and neck with one-time rising star MJ Hegar
(whose campaign one of us worked on). But by the time voting began Cornyn pulled away and was
polling above 50% with some consistency. Cornyn achieved a comfortable 10-point victory.
The last time Texans had a race this close this late in the election was Cruz?s re-election bid in
2018 in which he narrowly beat O?Rourke by less than 3 points. But that year the senator?s polling
looked rosier then than it does today. In the world of campaign politics any incumbent stuck under
50% in the polls when votes are days away is leaving the door open to a loss.
Just ask former Georgia Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. In their 2020 elections just like
Cruz now incumbent Republicans in a historically red state failed to clear 50% in public polling. Both
lost to exciting young dynamic Democratic challengers costing the GOP the Senate.
Recent appearances suggest Cruz is feeling that heat. On Fox News host Sean Hannity?s showMonday Cruz begged for donations and plugged his campaign website a half-dozen times. On a
different Fox appearance Cruz lashed out at his own party ? attacking Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell by name for not spending on his race and accusing him of only spending his $400 million
on the senators ?who obey him.?
A winning Democratic coalition in Texas is extremely diverse and fragile.
Why has this race been different? It?s true that Cruz is flailing. But while the senator has refused to
clarify his own positions and been ruthlessly mocked in the press Allred has put together an
exceedingly impressive campaign. He has painted himself to be everything Cruz is not contrasting
Cruz?s Jan. 6 behavior with his own willingness to defend the House floor when the mob came
rushing in. He painted quite a picture of himself that day: taking his jacket off sending loving texts to
his wife and getting ready to physically fight the threat to democracy.
Allred is also a former NFL linebacker with a bright white smile. He helped a Texas family free their
Marine son from Russian captivity when Cruz did not and the Marine?s father Joey Reed has
created searing campaign ads for the explicit purpose of removing Cruz from office. Allred?s bravery
may not be enough on its own ? but it sings when compared to Cruz?s cowardice.
Allred is also running in a fundamentally different political environment than O?Rourke Hegar and
other promising Texas Democrats were. Progressive groups and Allred?s campaign have invested
tens of millions of dollars in Democratic political infrastructure in Texas. This massive infusion of
resources has helped raise the starting point for Allred ? and the shorter you have to climb the less
likely you are to fall.
As of Sept. 30 Allred had raised a total of $67 million during his run blowing past Hegar?s $29million total from 2020 and rivaling O?Rourke?s record-breaking $79 million from 2018. Cruz
admittedly has outraised Allred amassing almost $75 million as of Sept. 30. But Allred?s
fundraising has only increased as the election has neared. In the third quarter Allred brought in a
staggering $30 million outpacing Cruz?s $21 million haul and allowing Allred to outspend the
incumbent in the all-important home stretch of the race.
Allred has put that money to good use flooding the airwaves with ads emphasizing tried and true
broadly appealing populist campaign themes such as securing the border defending abortion
access protecting Medicare and Social Security and highlighting his NFL past.
Cruz?s advertising by contrast has dived headfirst into the culture wars. His ads mirror those of
former President Donald Trump?s campaign harping on trans kids participating in youth sports. One
such ad from a Cruz-supporting PAC depicts a large black man in an ?Allred? jersey viciously
tackling a girl attempting a catch in flag football. Obviously the implication that NFL linebackers are
playing girls? flag football is false (as is the suggestion you can clothesline a receiver in flag
football). It?s possible though perhaps optimistic that ads employing scare tactics against
nonexistent threats have begun to ring hollow for voters.
But this is Texas. Even though Allred is performing better than any statewide Democratic candidate
in recent history he?s not the favorite on Election Day. Kamala Harris? presidential campaign is
unlikely to spend substantial resources on turning out Texas voters. Cruz on the other hand will
assuredly reap downstream benefits from Trump?s efforts in Texas.
Additionally a winning Democratic coalition in Texas is extremely diverse and fragile. To get to 50%
+ 1 Allred will need to run up the score in urban centers especially among voters of color. He?ll
also need to persuade swing-y South Texas Hispanic voters and he?ll need to do that whilemaintaining the favor of white college-educated suburban voters.
It?s a huge mountain to climb ? and one that hasn?t been summited in 30 years. But if Allred
doesn?t emerge victorious he?s still carried Democrats further than any other candidate in recent
memory.",MSNBC_Ted_Cruz_really_could_lose.pdf.pdf,news_articles
47,Liberal,MSNBC,"The biggest myth about ?undecided? voters
If there?s one thing everyone can agree on about American politics it?s that we are extremely
polarized. Red and blue are so diametrically opposed and hostile to one another that they might as
well be different countries. Fewer voters are changing the party they vote for than ever before
especially in the last eight years.
But wait! If you are following the horse race coverage of the election the one thing that everyone
can agree on is that about 1 in 6 Americans are undecided or have weak vote preferences driving
the constant swings in each day?s new batch of polls especially in the battleground states. (And
even more so in ?the demographic that will determine the winner!?? like noncollege voters or
whatever the conventional wisdom is fixated on at the moment.)
Both of these ideas cannot be true and they aren?t. In reality there are far fewer genuinely
persuadable voters in America than there are survey respondents who say they are ?undecided.?
But we?re fooled by two things.
When taken literally poll questions exaggerate how many voters are actually movable.
The first problem is statistical noise. Here?s an illustrative thought experiment. Let?s say we?ve
been asking the same 2000 people every week for the last year which presidential candidate they
think they?ll vote for. You would expect to see almost no change week to week and not much more
change over a year or more. Indeed that?s the result we get in the real world from panel studies
that do exactly this. Yet if we ask a different set of 2000 people every week we will invariably see
swings ? not because individuals are changing their minds but because we are asking different
people.The second problem is that when taken literally poll questions exaggerate how many voters are
actually movable. To survey respondents choosing ?undecided? doesn?t always mean what
reporters writing about polls want it to mean ? open to voting for Harris or Trump. Rather many
people say they?re ?undecided? to express their ambivalence about the choice they will probably
make in the end.
That?s because question writing is more difficult than it appears. What the words mean to the
pollster are not always what the words mean to the survey taker. That?s why when I was political
director at the AFL-CIO we took cues from the social sciences and always experimented with
different ways of asking the same question. That way we could be sure that we were getting the
responses to the question we intended. Unfortunately most media polling analysts proceed with
complete confidence that the responses are to the question the pollsters intended or readers of
survey results presume.
Consider Sara a 24-year-old ?undecided? survey respondent. Like most young people she thinks
the country is on the wrong track and resists identifying with either party. She doesn?t always go out
of her way to vote. She had no enthusiasm whatsoever about President Joe Biden and she isn?t
sure yet how she feels about Vice President Kamala Harris. But since 2018 people like Sara have
turned out in historic numbers that have made the difference between Democrats? losses in 2016
and subsequent victories. The patterns of these turnout surges indicate that these voters are
anti-MAGA but not necessarily pro-Democrat. They are motivated by loss aversion ? fearing
(correctly) that they could lose their freedoms if MAGA wins. So when Sara is asked which
candidate she favors she really doesn?t ?favor? either of them. But if she votes it won?t be for
Trump.
We can get deeper confirmation of this dynamic by looking at an adjacent question ? partyidentification. In most surveys voters are asked which party they support and if independent which
way they lean. At the AFL-CIO we experimented with adding another question about party ID at the
end of the survey: ?Do you always vote for Democrats usually vote for Democrats usually vote for
Republicans or always vote for Republicans?? Given this choice about 90% of respondents said
they usually or always vote for one or the other party and less than 10% volunteered some other
answer like ?both parties equally.? When we reinterviewed the same people after the election we
learned that the extra question overwhelmingly predicted the vote choice of people who declared no
party affiliation earlier in the survey or had said they were undecided. What?s more the people who
weren?t frequent or always single-party voters usually just didn?t vote.
We risk that too many of the infrequent anti-MAGA voters who helped Democrats win before will
stay home in November.
In short we should be skeptical of swings in the polls greater than the swings from any election to
another in the 21st century (except for the Great Crash landslide in 2008). Nor should we
breathlessly accept numerous demographic realignments that are certain in the surveys but never
arrive on Election Day. In truth the epic realignment is the one that followed the 2008 election.
Since then both parties have become largely regional parties again now along the Dobbs line that
is barely displaced from the original Mason-Dixon line.
The key to Harris? chances lies not with voters who are truly undecided between two candidates
but those undecided between casting a Democratic ballot and staying home. Our discourse refuses
to recognize that every American has three choices in a presidential election: voting for the
Democrat voting for the Republican or not voting at all. (In our winner-take-all system voting third
party has the same practical effect as not voting.) We obsess over the people who might be torn
between options 1 and 2 yet we ignore the people who might choose option 3.We ignore these voters at our peril. While Harris has done a terrific job reconsolidating and inspiring
Democrats perceptions of how dangerous a second Trump administration seem to have stalled. If
that doesn?t change we risk that too many of the infrequent anti-MAGA voters who helped
Democrats win before will stay home in November. And if that happens it will be an unforgivable
failure of the media and civil society to alert Americans to the very avoidable consequences of
Trump regaining power.",MSNBC_The_biggest_myth_about_‘undecided’_voters.pdf.pdf,news_articles
48,Liberal,MSNBC,"This ?gender gap? narrative hides the truth about Trump?s white
female fans
No force is as animating in this election as gender. One candidate stands to be the first female
president of the United States while the other runs a campaign of aggrieved masculinity. Abortion
remains a top campaign issue after Donald Trump appointed Supreme Court justices who
overturned Roe v. Wade and set reproductive rights back by in some states as many as 150 years.
And finally there are the voters among whom a vast gender gap has cleaved open.
Recent NBC News polling shows women breaking for Vice President Kamala Harris by 14 points.
Men on the other hand support the former president by a 16-point margin. The gender gap is so
pronounced that Trump who dropped out of the third presidential debate after losing the second
one to Harris participated in a Fox News town hall that aired Wednesday to talk specifically to
female voters. The audience which was women only watched as Trump called Sen. Katie Britt
""fantastically attractive"" and bizarrely anointed himself the ?father of IVF.?
?Female voters? are a notably heterogenous pool and considering them as a single entity is
unhelpful bordering on political malpractice.
Much has been written about the overt gender politics of this election. Harris seems to be playing
down her gender presumably in an effort to appeal to a broad swath of voters but the historic
nature of her candidacy makes the issue hard to hide. Trump on the other hand chose a running
mate who has repeatedly maligned ?childless cat ladies.? Hulk Hogan ripped off a U.S. flag tank top
at the Republican National Convention. Even some Trump supporters say they worry that the
campaign's testosterone-fueled boorish rhetoric may be turning off female voters.
But ?female voters? are a notably heterogenous pool and considering them as a single entity isunhelpful bordering on political malpractice. Take for example the discourse around white women
which came to the fore after Trump won this demographic in 2016. It is true that more white women
voted for Trump than for then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and they may very well do so
again. But white women are the country?s largest voting bloc when you break the electorate out by
race and gender and this enormous group was almost evenly divided in 2016 and 2020.
According to Pew data white voters made up nearly 70% of the electorate in 2016 (Black and
Hispanic voters each made up 11%). Women outvoted men that same year with 67% of white
women saying they voted in 2016. By comparison 63% of white men and 64% of Black women
voted along with just 54% of Black men 50% of Hispanic women 45% of Hispanic men fewer than
half of Asian men and women.
Democrats absolutely must turn out voters of color in order to win and Black voters in particular
have been essential to Democratic victories. But Democrats could potentially secure every nonwhite
vote in the U.S. and still lose. They have to figure out which white voters ? specifically white women
? are winnable. And that means resisting the urge to dumb things down. Observations about huge
demographic groups ? things such as ?white women voted for Trump? or ?women are backing
Harris? ? don?t tell us nearly enough.
Understanding the why behind the Trump-supporting segments of these huge populations is key.
Trump?s base includes several subgroups of white women: those without college degrees those
who are evangelical Christians and those who live in the South. According to a recent NPR/PBS
News/Marist Poll close to 60% of college-educated white women say they plan to vote for Harris
while 55% of white women without college degrees and a whopping 70% of white men without
degrees are backing Trump. So one crucial question becomes: How can Trump?s boorish behavior
be so appalling to so many women and seemingly so acceptable to others?The answer lies in various stubborn American subcultural norms. Male violence is a problem
everywhere for example but researchers have pointed to the ways in which white Southern honor
culture is different from say the dominant culture of the Northeast. Southern white women in
particular have long been portrayed as objects that both demand and require protection; similar
narratives of female weakness and the necessity of male protection and authority suffuse white
evangelical religious beliefs. And the benefits of male protection and respect are higher because the
penalties are more extreme. A woman who is seen as sexually audacious (or simply a feminist) will
almost certainly have a harder go of it in a white Southern Baptist community than among say
white college-educated Brooklynites.
One crucial question becomes: How can Trump?s boorish behavior be so appalling to so many
women and seemingly so acceptable to others?
There?s also some evidence that men overcompensate and become more aggressive when their
status is threatened. One 2013 study found that ?men given feedback suggesting they were
feminine expressed more support for war homophobic attitudes and interest in purchasing an
SUV.? Members of the Trump campaign team have taken to accusing insufficiently MAGA men of
being ?cucks? ? slang for men emasculated by cheating wives.
White evangelical churches may not as readily embrace the naughty words but they have long
evinced a toned-down version of the same misogyny adopting edicts of male leadership and female
submission. Women are not allowed to take senior pastor and other top leadership roles in many
(and possibly most) evangelical churches; the Southern Baptist Convention America?s largest
evangelical denomination has purged churches that ordain women as pastors.James Dobson founder of Focus on the Family and one of the country?s most influential
evangelicals is clear on ?the role of the female as help-meet bread-baker wound-patcher love
giver home builder and child-bearer? and the female obligation of submission to masculine
leadership (he does generously encourage husbands to give their wives ?one day of recreation
each week?). It?s unsurprising that women steeped in a culture that not only demands but also
sanctifies female submission and male dominance might not embrace a female leader. Outside of
the church women who are more accustomed to conservative cultural norms of male grievance
aggression and violence may simply have a greater tolerance for Trump?s actions and rhetoric.
This is not to say that college-educated women living in large northern cities are surrounded by
wonderfully feminist men; bad male behavior that includes violence and simple entitlement is
everywhere. But there really are significant cultural differences between white Americans according
to region religion education and urbanity and these differences make for very different political
preferences and voting patterns.
The overarching gender gap narrative is true. Trump really is cleaning up with male voters and
white ones in particular. He really is making inroads with Black men: While 80% of Black men voted
for Joe Biden in 2020 70% now say they support Harris according to a recent New York
Times/Siena poll while 1 in 5 are backing Trump. But this needs more context. The ?Black men for
Trump? story is interesting primarily because it?s a shift not because anything close to a majority of
Black men support Trump. The fact that Harris enjoys the support of 70% of Black men means that
demographic backs her more strongly than any other race/gender group except Black women.
The numbers for Hispanic voters are far starker according to that same Times/Siena poll: Trump is
winning Hispanic men by 5 points while 59% of Hispanic women currently support Harris. And
Harris really is doing quite well with women. According to some polls she is even enjoying a smalllead among white women.
White women remain the least likely to support Democrats. That fact can lend itself to easy
narratives.
Among female voters white women remain the least likely to support Democrats. That fact can lend
itself to easy narratives and self-righteousness becoming a justification for finger-wagging: After
Trump narrowly won the white female vote in 2016 a few demonstrators at the anti-Trump
Women?s March held signs admonishing white women even though the pussy-hat-wearing
marchers were not the white ladies who voted him into office. In response many white liberal
women pledged to ?do better? and call in their peers despite the fact that liberal white
college-educated women living in big cities likely have few if any Trump-voting pals. An important
moment of reckoning ? a realization that a lot of women do not vote in what feminists would say are
their interests ? became unfortunately a vast oversimplification.
Ultimately elections capture a population at a particular moment in time. The work of social
movements is to shift the views of that population over time not just to win elections but also to
change societies. To understand the race and gender gaps in this election we must also
understand how the power of male grievance plays in different cultural contexts. In a country as vast
and diverse as the U.S. culture shifts not just along racial lines but also according to where one
lives how (and if) one worships what opportunities one does or does not have access to and ? for
women ? how the men around them feel about their status as men and how those men behave as a
result.",MSNBC_This_‘gender_gap’_narrative_hides_the_truth_about_.pdf.pdf,news_articles
49,Liberal,MSNBC,"Trump is betting it all on Election Day turnout. Here's how that could
backfire.
The polls still show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close
race both nationally and in most swing states. With the results likely falling on a knife?s edge the
deciding factor may well be which side is best able to drive voters to the polls. But if that?s the case
Republicans are acting at a disadvantage that can only be ascribed to Trump himself.
Republicans are acting at a disadvantage that can only be ascribed to Trump himself.
Modern elections are more of an ?election month? in many states with early voting and mail-in
ballots offering opportunities to cast votes long before Election Day. This was previously a
nonpartisan issue but things have been thrown into disarray for Republicans since Trump?s 2020
re-election campaign. Democratic-led states in particular had moved to set up more ballot drop
boxes pre-emptively send out mail-in ballot request forms and otherwise help people vote safely in
the middle of a pandemic.
Naturally Trump quickly began falsely claiming that mail-in voting leads to mass voter fraud a claim
that formed the backbone of his attempts to overturn his loss that year and soured many of his
supporters on early voting. No such mass fraud has ever been discovered but that hasn?t stopped
Trump from periodically returning to the matter. There are times when he?s managed to stop
promoting conspiracy theories long enough to praise early voting ? but he always returns to old
habits soon enough. Just two weeks ago he told a crowd in Pennsylvania a state he needs to win
that early voting is ?stupid.?
Republicans have begun to realize how much Trump?s rhetoric is impeding their efforts to stockpile
votes before polls open next month. ?The whole idea behind absentee voting is you?re banking thatvote you?ve got that person you know they?re going to vote for you you get them off the list?
Republican strategist Mark Graul recently told Politico. ?This is how you get the extra 5000 10000
votes that may decide the election.?
Rather than heed that advice the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have
focused on Election Day. An increased reliance on day-of turnout would be a risk any year but
especially given how Trump has bound the RNC?s hands ahead of this election. Upon becoming
the nominee this year Trump decreed that the GOP should invest less in traditional get-out-the-vote
efforts in favor of more ?election integrity? programs.
The resulting cuts have led to outsourcing most turnout programs to outside groups taking
advantage of newly revised Federal Election Commission rules that allow increased cooperation
between campaigns and super PACs. Those outside groups haven?t exactly been impressive in
their efforts leading some battleground Republicans to question how effective they?ll actually prove
at getting people to the polls. For example Turning Point USA the group run by conservative
activist Charlie Kirk has told Semafor that its lofty goals for voter outreach had been narrowed to
mostly focus on Arizona and Wisconsin.
The Elon Musk-backed group America PAC has shown the most promise so far hiring veteran GOP
operatives and spending more than $50 million on voter engagement this cycle. That money has
gone into hiring hundreds of canvassers in swing states like Michigan and North Carolina. America
PAC also on Monday put even more of Musk?s money on the table promising $47 for each
registered voter recruited to sign a petition pledging support for the First and Second amendments
building out the group?s engagement lists.
The Trump campaign for its part points to the unpaid ?Trump 47 Captains? it?s recruiting to proveit isn?t fully giving up the GOTV game. ?Each volunteer initially receives a list of 10 neighbors to
mobilize? The Guardian?s Hugo Lowell wrote about the program which offers campaign
merchandise to those who hit their goals. ?If they meet that target the next tier involves canvassing
24 out of 50 likely Trump voters followed by canvassing 45 out of 100 voters with new perks at
each tier.? (If that sounds like the same framework as a multilevel marketing scam to you don?t
worry I?m right there with you.)
It?s an idea also being pushed on a website called 10xVotes which encourages conservatives to
?find 10 friends who don?t vote.? The site which is available in a few swing states including
Michigan and Arizona appears to draw from voting records to allow users to search for registered
Republicans nearby to ?claim? for contact. It?s unclear who exactly owns 10xVotes which has been
pushed by the likes of former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former Trump adviser Steve
Bannon?s ?War Room? podcast.
Republican operatives aren?t feeling especially confident about the ground game that?s in place in
key states.
The Trump campaign appears to be working off a theory wherein if it can?t win over the swing
voters that Harris is also courting it can draw out the sort of ?low propensity voters? who propelled
him to office in 2016 ? for example the cringeworthy push to court young white males the kind who
feel disaffected but love the hypermasculinity offered on right-wing podcasts and in the MMA ring.
One major issue with that strategy: These are also exactly the voters who can?t be counted on to
turn out on Election Day without frequent contact.
Taken together Republican operatives aren?t feeling especially confident about the ground game
that?s in place in key states. As National Review?s Noah Rothman has noted the efforts arelooking more like 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney?s doomed initiative than President Barack
Obama?s dominant GOTV program that year. Other candidates might be thinking about shifting
where their funds are going to offset those worries.
Not Trump though not when he?s ready to blame a failure to win enough votes on what Axios
described as a ?detailed catalog of excuses for rejecting the results of the 2024 election ? if he
loses.? The guarantee that this will be his response to a loss helps explain his overall nonchalance
about getting people to their polling places. After all it?s much easier (and cheaper) to try to throw
out Democratic votes than bother paying people to knock on doors.",MSNBC_Trump_is_betting_it_all_on_Election_Day_turnout._H.pdf.pdf,news_articles
50,Liberal,MSNBC,"Trump makes a big bet on low-propensity voters
With two weeks to go the race for the White House may hinge on whether Donald Trump can cash
in a big bet.
Spurning a traditional playbook of welcoming back estranged Republicans and fighting for votes in
the middle Trump is instead trying to create a winning coalition by adding new younger voters who
embrace him for his very defiance of what?s expected of a politician.
The problem? No one knows whether they?ll actually show up.
Trump?s strategy relies on what campaigns call low-propensity voters: those who don?t consistently
participate in elections. There?s no question there is a large population of young male often white
(though not exclusively) Americans who find Trump?s antics and tough guy schtick appealing and
think Democrats are a drag. Trump and his campaign have methodically wooed this bro vote; it?s no
doubt played a role in his strength with men in the polls.
So-called Nikki Haley voters would have been an obvious place for Trump to go fishing for votes
outside of his base but his ego wouldn?t allow him to seek the approval of those who spurned him
in the primary. Instead Trump is hoping his largely outsourced voter contact operation as well as a
legion of online influencers can convince young men to get off YouTube and into a polling place.
Every campaign tries to squeeze out as many marginal votes as it can but no recent one has
banked so heavily on a low-participation voting bloc to turn out. If Trump wins it may be because
he?s once again figured out a new formula that didn't require him to moderate his impulses.

51,Liberal,MSNBC,"Voter registration is way too complicated. But there?s a very simple
solution.
While looking for a late-night coffee my wife and I recently found ourselves at a hip new D.C.
restaurant. Even though it was late on a Monday night the host informed us that to get a table we
would need to have made a reservation a week earlier at precisely 10:30 a.m. Fortunately we were
able to snag a seat that opened up at the bar and our date night continued without further
complications.
Now I?m not complaining. It?s a tiny bistro from an award-winning chef in one of the city?s hottest
neighborhoods. Of course I?m going to have to do a little advance work to get in and if I don?t well
there are a lot of other places in the city to get a cup of coffee.
But as a country we?ve been applying this same model to voting and it?s a disaster. If you want to
cast a ballot in November in Arizona ? to name just one crucial swing state ? you need to have
registered to vote by Oct. 7. If you didn't you'll have to wait until the next election. (Rules vary so
you may still be able to vote in other states and you can always request a provisional ballot.)
We have come to accept this sorry state of affairs but it doesn?t make any sense. You can be a
U.S. citizen at least 18 years of age with no criminal record and in many states you won?t be
allowed to cast a ballot on Election Day because you didn?t file some paperwork anywhere from
eight days to a month earlier.
You didn't even need to register to vote for the first hundred years of the nation's history.
But this isn?t a restaurant reservation; it?s your right. The Constitution doesn?t say anything about
registering to vote ahead of time. As a matter of fact you didn?t even need to register to vote for thefirst hundred years of the nation?s history; you just showed up at the polling place. Even today you
don?t need to register if you live in North Dakota the only state that still doesn?t have a voter
registration law.
So why do we do it? Voter registration got its start in the late 19th century in the Northeast as cities
became too large for poll workers to either recognize voters by face or handle the crush of people
showing up on Election Day. But make no mistake such laws were designed from the very start to
suppress the vote especially votes from the immigrants arriving on American shores at the time.
Consider just a few examples from Alexander Keyssar?s comprehensive history ?The Right to
Vote.? An 1866 law in New Jersey required all voters to register on the preceding Thursday ? a day
that blue-collar immigrant workers would be unable to take off. An 1885 law in Chicago required
voters to register on one of two Tuesdays just before the election. And a 1908 law clearly targeting
Jewish immigrants in New York City required would-be voters to register either on a Saturday or on
Yom Kippur. Many of these laws did not apply to rural voters who were less likely to be recent
immigrants.
In the South strict voter registration laws became part and parcel of a massive effort to
disenfranchise Black voters in the post-Reconstruction era that included poll taxes and literacy tests.
These efforts continue today. In Georgia a new law that Republican activists are exploiting allows
people to challenge the voter registrations of people they think might be ineligible. Since the law
partially took effect in July activists have challenged more than 63000 voter registrations mostly in
majority-Democratic counties around Atlanta according to a survey by The Associated Press.
For now county officials are rejecting the vast majority of the challenges but activists are pushingfor them to throw out more registrations.
Advocates for these kinds of purges argue that they are needed to ?clean up? the voter rolls of
people who have moved away. But there are already processes in place to remove voters who have
subsequently registered in other counties and some states even compare records to help minimize
duplicate registrations. Even if a voter remains on the rolls mistakenly that?s only a problem if they
cast a ballot and there?s no evidence that?s happening in any kind of widespread way.
I understand the concern. But if you want to remove the people from the voter rolls who shouldn?t
be there without removing people who should be there then there?s a better way.
It's the ultimate fail-safe for voters who forgot to register before an arbitrary deadline.
It?s called same-day voter registration and it?s already the law in 23 states plus Washington D.C.
Under these laws people who show up to vote on Election Day but aren?t on the voter rolls can
register to vote right then and there. It?s the ultimate fail-safe for voters who forgot to register before
an arbitrary deadline or were mistakenly removed from the voter rolls by an overly aggressive purge.
You might think of it as the democratic equivalent of getting a seat at the bar instead of at a table.
You?re still in the restaurant and you can still get something to eat and a cup of coffee ? even if you
didn?t plan ahead of time.
If as Republicans are fond of saying they want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat
supporting the expansion of same-day voter registration to all 50 states would make their arguments
that aggressive voter roll purges are necessary a lot more convincing ? and any purges a lot less
damaging to legitimate voters.Because you can always get a cup of coffee in another restaurant. But if you?re denied the right to
vote on Election Day there?s no second chance.

52,Liberal,MSNBC,"Why aren't states impacted by Hurricanes Milton and Helene trying to
extend voter registration?
UPDATE (Oct. 10 2024 2:15 p.m. ET): Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida on Wednesday
evening leaving a trail of destruction that killed at least 11 people and left millions without power.
With Hurricane Milton expected to make landfall in Florida Wednesday night many people in the
Sunshine State are bracing for potentially historic devastation. Meanwhile federal officials are
questioning the Federal Emergency Management Agency?s capacity to handle another catastrophic
storm so soon after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc across North Carolina and five other states.
Given Helene?s human toll and Milton?s expected disaster you might ask ?Who could possibly
think about an election at a time like this?? And yet for election administrators in these states there
is little choice. A presidential election waits for no one.
And so from Tallahassee to Charlotte state officials already have consulted applicable statutes and
regulations and modified typical procedures to ensure that their residents can freely and fairly
exercise their rights to vote.
To date none of the impacted states' officials with authority over elections has voluntarily extended
registration deadlines.
In particular North Carolina?s five-member board of elections voted unanimously on Monday to give
voters in 13 counties multiple accommodations including more time to request and receive ballots
by mail. The board also gave county boards latitude ? so long as a bipartisan majority is in favor ? to
change their schedules and hours for early voting which begins on Oct. 17 among other things.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis implemented similar adjustments for 13 counties in his state through anexecutive order he signed last week.
On one hand they should be applauded for their quick thinking and flexibility in the face of disaster.
But they should also be asked whether the measures they've taken went far enough especially with
respect to eligible voters who had yet to register before Helene hit. To date none of the impacted
states' officials with authority over elections has voluntarily extended registration deadlines even as
roads remain buckled phone lines have not been restored and designated polling sites are
damaged inaccessible and unusable.
In North Carolina that's perhaps understandable. After all prospective voters can register and then
vote on the same day if they go to an early voting site between Oct. 17 and Nov. 2.
But the failure to protect potential eligible voters in other places makes little sense.
For instance in South Carolina as of Oct. 4 ?[s]everal county voter registration offices were closed
for days before being able to reopen for registration? while offices in three counties remained
closed according to the South Carolina Election Commission. Yet neither the attorney general nor
the governor took action to extend the voter registration deadline.
Therefore the South Carolina Democratic Party sued asking a court to order the state's election
commission to extend the registration deadline. And on Oct. 4 ? the deadline for in-person
registration and just days before the deadlines for electronic and mail-in registration ? Judge Daniel
Coble gave all South Carolinians until Oct. 14 to register whether in person or by mail email fax or
internet.
Coble who was initially appointed by GOP Gov. Henry McMaster and allowed the state to enforceits six-week abortion ban earlier this year might not seem the likeliest judge to take what seems like
a liberal approach to voting access. But faced with the choice of unfairly denying the franchise to
hurricane victims versus giving other potential voters extra unearned days to register he erred on
the side of facilitating all citizens' ability to vote.
Voting rights advocates in other Helene-impacted states have taken notice. On the day of Georgia's
voter registration deadline Oct. 7 the NAACP's Georgia chapter and two other groups filed a
lawsuit in Atlanta federal court seeking an immediate extension to Oct. 14 as well. Noting that there
is historically a spike in voter registration right before the deadline these plaintiffs argued that there
are likely ""thousands of voters who could not register while power was down roads were impassible
and county election and post offices were closed.""
Declarations from local leaders underscore how some registration efforts had to be abandoned in
the wake of Helene. For example one Georgia non-profit focused on voter registration education
and turnout efforts in historically marginalized communities not only canceled all door-to-door
canvassing efforts in two Georgia counties between Oct. 4 and 7 but also could not pick up and
drop off voter registration materials to the board of elections in one of those counties because its
office has been closed since Sept. 27.
Indeed on Oct. 8 just one day after the Georgia deadline the state's Republican governor Brian
Kemp issued an executive order extending a state of emergency for nearly 70 Georgia counties
through Oct. 16. Yet judging by his statements Georgia's secretary of state seems to think Helene
will not cause anything more than minimal disruption to this election if that. His website similarly
suggests the most important election-related accommodations necessary for Georgians impacted by
Helene are allowing them to receive their absentee ballots at a new temporary address or helping
them obtain a new state ID if theirs was lost due to Helene.In the meantime a hearing was held in the Georgia case on the afternoon of Oct. 9. There Judge
Eleanor Ross denied the plaintiffs' request for one form of emergency relief that would extend the
deadline but scheduled a second hearing for Oct. 10 where according to NAACP Conference of
Georgia President Gerald Griggs she asked for testimony from prospective voters who were not
able to register because of the hurricane. After the hearing Griggs remarked ""So we lost the battle
but might be able to win the war.""
And then there is Florida where on Monday Florida's registration deadline DeSantis issued a new
state of emergency for 54 counties and suspended tolls across Central and Western Florida to allow
residents to begin recommended or mandated evacuations. Yet DeSantis also maintained Monday
that the registration deadline should not be extended arguing ""People can register today. There's
nothing inhibiting you registering today. The storm"" meaning Hurricane Milton ""has not hit yet.""
That did not sit well with Florida's NAACP or its League of Women Voters which represented by
the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday to extend the registration
deadline arguing that between Helene recovery and Milton preparation it was ""impossible or unduly
burdensome"" for many Floridians to register by Oct. 7.
In that case too a judge held a hearing on the plaintiffs' request for emergency relief for the
afternoon of Oct. 9. He ruled against extending the deadline. As of publication time the plaintiffs had
not decided whether to appeal.
Will Georgians ultimately get the relief South Carolinians have already received ? and that Floridians
have been thus far denied? Watch this space.",MSNBC_Why_aren_t_states_impacted_by_Hurricanes_Milton_an.pdf.pdf,news_articles
53,Liberal,MSNBC,"Why many Democrats find this presidential campaign uniquely
unsettling
There is one question that dominates every political conversation and every group chat in
Democratic enclaves across America and it?s not ?Will Kamala Harris win the election?? It?s ?How
is Donald Trump this close to winning??
Some of this concern is typical in every modern election. Republicans radiate confidence while
Democrats fret. Political science also provides a simple answer to Trump?s continued popularity.
We live in a narrowly divided country where Republicans traditionally vote for Republican candidates
? and the same goes for Democrats. Every modern election is relatively close. Incumbent parties
around the world and across the political spectrum have struggled after the pandemic and related
inflation increases.
For many Democrats Trump?s continued viability as a presidential candidate speaks to something
more fundamental and concerning.
Emotionally however this is hardly a satisfactory answer. For many Democrats Trump?s continued
viability as a presidential candidate speaks to something more fundamental and concerning: How
can someone as odious and malignant as Trump maintain so much popular support?
It?s not just that Trump?s four years in office were defined by unimaginable incompetence venality
chaos and cruelty. It?s not just that he is a convicted felon who spurred an insurrection and still
refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election. It?s not just that many Democrats can?t
comprehend why anyone would want to return to those days.
The larger and more disquieting issue is the campaign Trump is running right now: one that is as vileand as openly racist as any campaign in perhaps all of American history ? and that includes his
previous runs for the White House.
Virtually Trump?s entire message to voters this year is about the alleged threat represented by
immigrants ? both legal and illegal. A recent review of his speeches by Politico summarized them
this way: ?Trump has demonized minority groups and used increasingly dark graphic imagery to
talk about migrants in every one of his speeches since the Sept. 10 presidential debate.?
More than ever Trump?s rhetoric is steeped in racism xenophobia and dehumanization. He
routinely calls immigrants ?vermin? and says they are ?poisoning the blood? of the country. He
claims they are ?stone-cold killers? ?animals? and ?the worst people? who will ?cut your throat.?
(This is unsurprisingly not true. Crime rates among immigrants are lower than those among
native-born Americans.) Last week in Colorado he called migrants from Latin America Congo and
the Middle East ?the most violent people on Earth.? He also accused Harris of importing ?an army
of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World ? to prey
upon innocent American citizens.? He?s even suggested that nonwhite immigrants have ?bad
genes? that make them genetically inferior.
This is fascist rhetoric. More specifically it?s Nazi rhetoric. But the crowds at Trump?s rallies aren?t
horrified by such language. They lap it up.
Is this really what America has become?
Trump is openly trafficking in racial fear and paying little political price for doing so. The centerpiece
of Trump?s immigration policy is a call for massive detention camps and the mass deportation of
illegal migrants. At this summer?s Republican National Convention the GOP printed up anddistributed thousands of signs to the assembled delegates that read ?Mass Deportation Now.?
Trump has even suggested that migrants who are in the country legally must be deported ? like the
Haitian migrants in Springfield Ohio whom he has repeatedly and falsely accused of eating dogs
and cats.
There are surely voters who take Trump seriously but not literally ? and refuse to believe he will
follow through on his rhetoric. But when Trump was president his administration initiated a policy of
forcibly separating young children from their parents as a tool for deterring illegal immigration. And
even if Trump doesn?t mean it now why would these voters want to associate themselves with
language not dissimilar from actual Nazis?
It?s not just Trump?s language about immigrants that is so troubling. I?m old enough to remember
when George H.W. Bush calling his opponents ?bozos? in 1992 was considered untoward. Hillary
Clinton was vilified for referring to half of Trump?s supporters as ?deplorable.? Now Trump
regularly refers to his political opponents as ?an enemy within.? He has talked about taking
?retribution? against Democrats whom he calls ?evil.? In recent days he?s even suggested he
would unleash the U.S. military on his political rivals.
Trump?s ability to carry out such threats might be constrained by the courts and even the military?s
own unwillingness to conduct illegal domestic operations. But that hardly seems like a risk worth
taking.
Yet the bigger danger of a Trump campaign is that so many Americans will go to the polls and
validate Trump?s bigotry violent rhetoric and divisiveness. For more than a few Democrats the lack
of political backlash from comments that would spell the end of any other presidential campaign is
as much as the tight polling margin what has made this presidential campaign so uniquelyunsettling. Is this really what America has become?
Many Democrats would have viewed the election of John McCain in 2008 or Mitt Romney in 2012 as
disastrous events but hardly ones that made them question the sustainability of the American
experiment in representative democracy. A Trump victory would represent something very different
? the endorsement of a national ethos that runs utterly contrary to the arc of modern American
history which has imperfectly bent toward justice.
Even if Trump loses he will still likely get 45%-47% of the popular vote. How does America move
forward when so many of our fellow citizens embrace a candidate and a message so fundamentally
un-American? Defeating Trump is obviously essential but as this presidential election like the two
before it has made clear America is a very different place than many of us imagined.",MSNBC_Why_many_Democrats_find_this_presidential_campaign.pdf.pdf,news_articles
54,Liberal,MSNBC,"Why new polling should be a wake-up call for the Democrats
This is an adapted excerpt from the Oct. 13 episode of ""Ayman.""
With just a little more than three weeks to go until Election Day the race between Vice President
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is a dead heat. New NBC News polling released Sunday has the
race tied with Harris and Trump both at 48% nationally among registered voters. It?s a noticeable
drop from last month?s NBC News poll that had Harris leading Trump by five points within the
margin of error.
What if adhering to presidential norms is the thing hurting Harris? campaign?
When Harris entered the race in July she brought with her a wave of momentum and excitement.
So just a few short months later many may be asking: How did we get here? How is the race still
this close?
After all Trump has been opting out of debates in favor of interviews with podcast bros ranting
nonsensically about circles and even appearing at Coachella ? of all places ? in a last-minute Hail
Mary attempt to win support in blue states.
Meanwhile Harris has been acting like a presidential candidate. She?s been holding town halls with
voters and spent all of last week going on a heavy-duty media blitz. But what if that?s the problem?
What if adhering to presidential norms is the thing hurting Harris? campaign?
After all she?s positioned herself as a new candidate for the future. It was a message anxious
Democrat voters needed to hear after President Joe Biden caved to pressure and dropped out of
the race. But since then she hasn?t distanced herself from Biden instead she?s held on tight tohim and his policies.
In two different interviews in just the past few days Harris was given the opportunity to explain how
her presidency would be different from Biden?s. But the best the vice president seemed to come up
with was telling Stephen Colbert ?I?m not Joe Biden but I?m not Donald Trump.?
The problem is that distinction may not be enough for voters. The closer she?s kept herself to
Biden?s unpopular policies especially on Gaza the more harmful it?s been for her campaign.
Instead of meeting with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement to ease their concerns about Israel?s
assault on Gaza and create daylight between Biden?s stance on the war and hers Harris is touting
the support of Republicans like former Rep. Liz Cheney. She?s even promised to convene a
bipartisan counsel of advisers including Republicans on policy should she win.
Compare the vice president?s polling position today to Trump?s in 2016. Eight years ago he was a
complete political novice. Voters had no idea how he would govern but they still voted him into
office. Today his supporters know exactly who he is and who he?ll be as president. So much so
that according to USA Today?s David Jackson Trump is polling better today than he was in 2016
and 2020.
The closer she?s kept herself to Biden?s unpopular policies especially on Gaza the more harmful
it?s been for her campaign.
This should serve as a wake-up call for the Harris campaign. With Trump the American people
know what they?re getting. He stands for fascism authoritarianism and the mass deportation of
undocumented immigrants.But the question for Democrats in this last stretch remains: What are you for? What is Harris for?
And in the end will it be enough to stop Trump and his authoritarian vision for the country?",MSNBC_Why_new_polling_should_be_a_wake-up_call_for_the_D.pdf.pdf,news_articles
55,Liberal,MSNBC,"Why the race for control of the U.S. Senate is intensifying
As most fair-minded observers would probably agree the race for the White House remains
anybody?s guess. No matter who wins the presidential contest however he or she is going to look
to the U.S. Senate to help govern and as it turns out figuring out which party will be in the
chamber?s majority next year isn?t easy either.
As regular readers know the Senate Democratic conference currently has a one-seat majority but
with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West Virginia Republicans have for all intents and purposes
already flipped one seat.
With this in mind Republicans will need a net gain of just one additional seat to secure a majority
which is hardly unrealistic given the number of tough races in states where there?s currently a
Democratic incumbent ? including races in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win
easily.
So where do things stand with 32 days remaining? Let?s take stock.
There are by most measures 11 Senate races that could credibly be described as ?competitive.?
Taking them one at a time in alphabetical order:
Arizona: Incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has led failed
Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake in nearly every poll for months and with an
abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout Gallego is the clear favorite.Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite Lake?s baggage from her 2022 race the
election denier isn?t being blown out and the fact that the race is competitive is keeping Democratic
money flowing into the state instead of other contests.
Florida: Incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: The far-right incumbent is not well liked; he has no
accomplishments or record of successes; an abortion-rights ballot measure is likely to boost turnout;
and polls suggest former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is keeping this contest far more
competitive than most thought possible.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day Florida is a red state filled with
voters who probably won?t care about the senator?s awful record; Scott is able to invest heavily
thanks to his considerable personal fortune; and Mucarsel-Powell is struggling to keep up financially
in a massive state with several expensive media markets.
Maryland: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin is retiring
Why Democrats feel good about the race: In one of the nation?s reliably blue states Angela
Alsobrooks? polling lead appears to be growing and it won?t hurt that there?s an abortion-rights
ballot measure on the statewide ballot.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: Larry Hogan remains popular in the state and the
former governor is benefiting from massive investments from Republican megadonors.
Michigan: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiringWhy Democrats feel good about the race: Most recent polling shows Elissa Slotkin well positioned to
prevail in a state that has elected a Republican senator only once in the past 50 years.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite former Rep. Mike Rogers? baggage ? he
moved to Florida after retiring from Congress ? he?s keeping the race close.
Montana: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking a fourth term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent
running on a record of success and it won?t hurt that there?s an abortion-rights ballot measure on
the statewide ballot.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: Polls suggest Tester is nevertheless losing to a
struggling Republican businessman who's facing controversies surrounding his racist rhetoric his
record of dishonesty about a gunshot wound and alleged plagiarism in his book.
Nebraska: Incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Independent Dan Osborn has stunned much of the
political world by running a strong race ? Republicans have scrambled in recent weeks to start airing
ads in a state they expected to ignore ? and polls suggest he?s within striking distance of an upset
victory. The fact that the ballot will include measures on abortion policy might also help tip the
scales.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day Nebraska is a reliably ruby-redstate.
Nevada: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is seeking a second term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Nevada is one of the nation?s most closely divided
battleground states but polls suggest Rosen is well positioned to prevail. Nevada is also one of the
states with an abortion-rights measure on the statewide ballot.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: Republican Sam Brown isn?t far behind the incumbent
and there?s still a lot of GOP money backing his candidacy.
Ohio: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is seeking a fourth term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana Brown is a respected and
accomplished incumbent running on a record of success. Unlike Tester recent polling shows Brown
hanging on to a small lead.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: Bernie Moreno isn?t exactly an impressive candidate
and he isn?t exactly running a good campaign but he?s still within 3 points of a popular senator
thanks in large part to the fact that Ohio is becoming a reliably red state.
Pennsylvania: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is seeking a fourth term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana and Brown in Ohio Casey is a
respected and accomplished incumbent running on a record of success. The latest polls also show
the senator with modest but steady leads.Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite his carpetbagger problem Dave McCormick is
still within striking distance of defeating a longtime incumbent.
Texas: Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is seeking a third term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is exactly the kind of
candidate who can appeal to a broad audience in Texas ? ?Republicans for Allred? has some
established and well-known figures on board ? and many GOP insiders have started to express real
anxiety in response to surprisingly close polls.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: For all of Cruz?s many troubles he still has an ?R? after
his name in Texas. With Trump expected to win the state with relative ease are there really a
significant number of voters who will vote for Trump and Allred on the same ballot? GOP insiders
believe the answer is no.
Wisconsin: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is seeking a third term
Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana Brown in Ohio and Casey in
Pennsylvania Baldwin is a respected and accomplished incumbent running on a record of success.
The latest polls also show the senator with modest-but-steady leads.
Why Republicans feel good about the race: In a dynamic similar to the Ohio contest Eric Hovde
isn?t exactly an impressive candidate and he isn?t exactly running a good campaign but he?s still
within 5 points of a popular senator.The stakes are high. Watch this space.",MSNBC_Why_the_race_for_control_of_the_U.S._Senate_is_int.pdf.pdf,news_articles

57,Liberal,USA TODAY,"10 facts about Tim Walz Kamala Harris' VP pick
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz is set to take the stage in New York City on
Tuesday where he?ll face off against his Republican rival JD Vance in the first and only VP debate.
But who exactly is this former teacher military veteran and Minnesota governor?
To get a better sense of Walz here are ten key facts you should know:
He served in the Army National Guard
Walz served 24 years in the National Guard starting as an infantryman at 17 in 1981 and retiring in
2005 to run for Congress. His father a Korean War veteran encouraged him to enlist while living in
Nebraska and later continued his service in Minnesota. Walz used the GI Bill to put himself through
college and re-enlisted after 9/11. He was deployed to help with natural disasters and supported
operations in Afghanistan from Italy.
Tune into the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS or
simulcast on www.usatoday.com.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
His teaching background is also a large part of his identity
After graduating from Chadron State College in Nebraska in 1989 with an undergraduate degree in
social science Walz spent a year teaching in China. He returned to Nebraska to teach high school
where he met his wife Gwen who was also a teacher. The couple later moved to Minnesota and
accepted teaching positions at Mankato West High School where he taught social studies andgeography.
Better known as ?Coach? in high school
At Mankato West High School Walz became a key figure on the coaching staff helping transform
the football program from a struggling team into a state powerhouse. When he joined the school the
team had lost 27 consecutive games but within three years his leadership helped guide them to a
state championship in 1999.
He has a history of winning tough elections
In 2006 Walz made headlines by defeating a Republican incumbent in a rural Minnesota district to
win a seat in Congress. After serving six terms in the U.S. House he ran for governor in 2018 and
won by 11 points beating Republican Jeff Johnson.
As governor Walz faced significant challenges including leading Minnesota through the COVID-19
pandemic with lockdowns school closures and business shutdowns. He also dealt with the
aftermath of George Floyd?s murder which sparked global protests and unrest in Minneapolis.
Despite these hurdles Walz won re-election in 2022 defeating Republican Scott Jensen.
He?s an avid hunter
Walz is a gun owner and avid hunter in his free time. He started the ?Governor?s Turkey Hunting
Opener? to kick off Minnesota?s turkey-hunting season and also hosts a similar event for the
pheasant-hunting season.During a recent appearance on CNN he appeared to challenge JD Vance to a shooting competition.
?I guarantee you he can?t shoot pheasants like I can? he told Anderson Cooper.
More:Harris campaign highlights Tim Walz family's IVF journey
He?s an advocate for reproductive health care
The Harris-Walz campaign has emphasized how Walz and his wife Gwen overcame years of
fertility challenges to conceive their daughter Grace.
?Governor Walz and Mrs. Walz struggled with years of fertility challenges and had their daughter
Hope through reproductive health care like IVF ? further cementing his commitment to ensuring all
Americans have access to this care? the Harris campaign said in a statement.
And a gay marriage ally
As a teacher Walz dedicated time and effort to helping his students establish the school?s first
Gay-Straight Alliance in 1999. He said it was important for the sponsor to be ?the football coach?
who was a soldier straight and married.
When he first ran for Congress in 2006 he ran on a platform that supported same-sex marriage.
He?s the guy who started calling MAGA Republicans ?weird?
Before he became Harris? running mate Walz made headlines by describing Donald Trump and
Republicans as ?weird? and it stuck.And during his first rally after Harris selected him as her vice president nominee in August Walz
slammed Vance as ?creepy? and ?just weird as hell.?
The message quickly took off on social media especially among young Americans. Although calling
opponents ?weird? or ?odd? isn?t a new tactic in American politics it represented a fresh strategy
for Democrats.
More:Tim Walz's working-class cred: no stocks no bonds and he doesn't own a home
He?s a ?Minnesota Lutheran?
Walz is Lutheran as are more than 20% of the Minnesota population according to the Pew
Research Center courtesy of Scandinavian Lutherans who settled in the region in the 19th century.
If elected Walz would become only the second Lutheran vice president?well maybe. Another
Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey was raised Lutheran but ended up attending a Methodist church
after his family moved to a city where there wasn?t a Lutheran one available.
He has at least one thing in common with JD Vance
Walz has shared that he stopped drinking alcohol after being pulled over for speeding in 1995 and
failing a sobriety test. He also avoids coffee opting for Diet Mountain Dew?just like his Republican
opponent.

early departure only supporting the claim that much further.
Of course Alabama fans who recall Trump?s inaugural appearance in Tuscaloosa would argue
otherwise as the Crimson Tide suffered its lone loss of the 2019-20 season to an LSU team on the
way to a national championship.
But how did Alabama football players and staff feel about the Republican national candidate's

From the time his attendance was announced by the university to his midgame arrival Alabama

Tight end CJ Dippre said he didn?t think it was a ?big distraction.? If anything he found it ?kind of
awesome.?
""I don't get into politics. I don't vote. I don't get into it just because I don't think I'm old enough to

59,Liberal,USA TODAY,"As the election nears Biden?s student debt agenda is in tatters. Will
it hurt Harris?
For many Americans overwhelmed by student loan debt the first week of October was bad.
On Monday of that week a yearlong grace period ended for student loan borrowers struggling to
make payments since the pandemic pause lifted a year ago. Two days later a separate program
meant to help borrowers in default get back on track also ceased.
The next day a federal judge in Missouri temporarily blocked President Joe Biden?s efforts to
finalize a broader student loan relief plan. That regulation ? his ?Plan B? after the Supreme Court
struck down his first big proposal ? would have fully canceled the debt of millions of longtime
borrowers and forgiven runaway interest for millions more. The ruling was especially jarring because
the day before the plan was halted in Missouri a federal judge in Georgia said it could go forward.
To sum it up: The federal student loan system is an even bigger mess than usual. Just a few weeks
before Election Day the Missouri case and other court challenges have barricaded several avenues
for student loan relief President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris touted this year. And
now borrowers in dire financial situations are staring down tougher consequences for evading bills
than they?ve likely reckoned with in years.
The potential implications at the ballot box of the legal whiplash are unclear however the
heightened politicization of the student loan system has left many Americans feeling financially
paralyzed.
?I would not expect any of this to be resolved before the election? said Preston Cooper a senior
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute a conservative think tank. ?If you?re holding your breathyou?re probably going to be holding it for a very long time.?
In a blog post this week the Education Department stressed the clock is ticking warning:
?Borrowers now have only three months until they face consequences for late payments ? making
our work to support student borrowers and reform the broken student loan system more important
than ever.?
Keeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.
What?s the status of student loan relief?
After the Supreme Court rebuked Biden?s first big attempt to help floundering borrowers millions of
whom could have had up to $20000 in debt wiped away the president's alternate strategies
garnered significant attention. Because there are many pathways to loan relief multiple court battles
are moving forward on different grounds.
The reforms that haven't been challenged are less controversial smaller-scale efforts. Reforming
guidance for student loan bankruptcy is one example of a debt relief tactic that has been less
vulnerable to lawsuits. The administration has also opened the door for more students who feel
defrauded by their colleges to file ?borrower defense? claims to get their debts canceled.
?They?ve delivered historic levels of debt relief? said Sara Partridge the associate director of
higher education policy at the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank. The Education
Department said earlier this year the Biden administration had forgiven roughly $170 billion in
student loan debt for about 5 million Americans.The larger reforms drew major pushback in court. Within weeks of the Supreme Court?s
controversial 2023 decision the Biden team began enrolling borrowers in a new income-driven
repayment plan which officials named Saving on a Valuable Education or SAVE. Miguel Cardona
the education secretary called it the ?most affordable repayment plan ever.? Through SAVE about
a half-million Americans were approved as of July for $5.5 billion in debt relief according to a
White House news release.
As officials began implementing the SAVE program the Education Department convened with
federal negotiators to map out a larger student loan forgiveness proposal. By April 2024 Biden
pledged that this separate more wide-reaching plan would eliminate interest beyond the original
loan amounts of 23 million borrowers.
By late August court challenges by Republican attorneys general stopped SAVE in its tracks. The
millions of borrowers enrolled in the plan and other income-based repayment programs are now in
interest-free forbearance while the court battles play out.
""It?s shameful that politically motivated lawsuits waged by Republican elected officials are once
again standing in the way of lower payments for millions of borrowers"" Cardona said in a statement
earlier this year responding to the litigation. ""President Biden Vice President Harris and I continue
to believe that college affordability is a cause worth fighting for ? and we?re not giving up.?
Biden?s bigger plan has also been temporarily blocked a development former President Donald
Trump's campaign praised.
""President Biden?s plan if you can call it that is a cynical ploy destined to fail that preys on the
anxieties of young people for political gain and is unfair to the millions of Americans who?ve paid offtheir student loan debt through hard work and sacrifice"" said Karoline Leavitt the Trump
campaign's national press secretary in a statement.
The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile borrowers counting on the various forms of debt relief are unsure about what comes
next.
?Attorneys and advocates like myself are often at a loss for what to tell people to do? said Ed Boltz
a bankruptcy lawyer in Durham North Carolina who helped advise the Education Department on its
broader forgiveness proposal. ?It?s a very frustrating time for everyone.?
Read more:Student loan borrowers were expecting more help. They're stuck waiting again.
Could the student loan chaos hurt Harris? Not exactly
Though student loan forgiveness may not rank as high for voters as other issues research shows
that support for generous debt cancellation can be politically beneficial to Democrats. In his
televised debate against Vice President Kamala Harris last month Trump capitalized on the
haphazard state of the Biden administration?s student loan agenda.
?They said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe?
he said. ?So all these students got taunted.?
Americans may not be so quick to blame Biden for the legal mess entangling his student debt
policies. A survey of 2000 adults conducted two months after the 2023 Supreme Court rulingsuggests opinions about the crisis are more nuanced. Many people attribute America's student loan
mess broadly to colleges student loan servicers and the courts according to Mallory SoRelle an
assistant professor of public policy at Duke University who has studied the political impacts of
student loan relief.
""President Biden actually gets the least blame"" she said. ?Our results would suggest that it should
not actually present a huge political cost for Biden or Harris to the extent that we think Harris is kind
of inheriting his legacy.""

60,Liberal,USA TODAY,"A look at the 'unofficial history' of U.S. Presidents attending college
football games
The Alabama-Georgia football matchup on Saturday in Tuscaloosa Alabama will be played in front
of a presidential crowd.
Former President Donald Trump the Republican nominee for the 2024 election will attend the top-5
SEC matchup between the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs. The matchup is a rematch of the 2023 SEC
Championship Game and the meeting between the two in Week 5 of the college football season
could have far-reaching impacts on the 12-team College Football Playoff.
REQUIRED READING:Alabama-Georgia football history: What are the most memorable Crimson
Tide vs Bulldogs games?
Trump himself is very familiar with the rivalry between Alabama and Georgia. In 2018 when he was
president Trump attended the 2018 National Championship game between the Crimson Tide and
Bulldogs on Jan. 8 2009 from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.
While Trump's visit to the game will not be when he is the president he made several visits to
college football games in office from 2016 to 2020. President Joe Biden has not attended a college
football game since he was elected in 2020. However seeing presidents at college football games

""I'm confident it will be fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful"" Biden told reporters making his
first appearance at the White House press briefing room over his nearly four years as president.
Trump the 2024 Republican nominee tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden by making
repeated baseless claims of election fraud an effort that culminated with a mob of supporters
attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6 2021. Trump faces federal criminal charges tied to his efforts but
has pleaded not guilty.
Ahead of the November 5 election Trump has made similar unsubstantiated claims of a ""rigged""

The claim: Former Trump supporters in Harris ad are actually Democratic actors

President Kamala Harris released a campaign ad featuring two Democratic actors.

Pennsylvania Farmers & Trump Voters who switched to Kamala"" reads text within the post which
was originally shared on X formerly Twitter. ""Turns out the two were not only actors but democrat

Our rating: False
The couple in Harris' ad debunked the claim. They said they are farmers and lifelong Republicans
who previously voted for former President Donald Trump not Democratic actors. Sky News issued a
correction on the broadcast before the Instagram post was made.
Claim that ad featured Democratic actors is baselessA campaign ad for Harris sparked criticism after her team shared it on YouTube on Sept. 24. The ad
features a Pennsylvania couple named Robert Lange and Kristina Chadwick Lange who say they
previously voted for Trump but are now switching to Harris because of the former president's
divisiveness.
Hours later an X user shared a post claiming the two are actors with a history of donating to
Democratic causes. The post which was viewed more than two million times in less than two
weeks includes screenshots of donations from the nonprofit campaign finance tracking website
OpenSecrets. The pictures show donations made by people with the same names as the
Pennsylvania couple.
After the X post was shared Sky News reported the claim in a live broadcast.
But Chadwick Lange told USA TODAY the claim is not true and is based on ""very poor research
skills.""
""The claims that we're Democrats that we're paid actors and that we have contributed to
Democratic campaigns are all lies"" Chadwick Lange said. ""Bob once donated to the Tom Ridge
campaign for Pennsylvania governor in the 1990s and I never made a single political donation to
any party.""
She said the two are still lifelong Republicans but ""cannot get behind Trump in this election.""

shot on the couple's farm and the screenplay was written by the two but they are not listed as
actors. They told Philadelphia outlet Savvy Main Line they had ""very small non-speaking roles as
monsters"" in the film.
Lange is chair of the Willistown Township's board of supervisors and has long been listed by the
Willistown-Malvern Republican Committee as one of the party's local elected officials.Lange told
WPVI-TV in Philadelphia that he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 while Chadwick Lange said she

him on NY's ballot
WASHINGTON ? Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked the Supreme Court to put him on the
presidential ballot in New York even as he has tried to get off the ballot in other states.
Kennedy's request comes a month after he suspended his independent campaign and endorsed
Donald Trump. In swing states where the election is close he has tried to take his name off the
ballot to avoid drawing votes away from the Republican nominee.
In an emergency petition filed Monday Kennedy argues judges in New York were wrong to
disqualify him over a dispute about his residency.
Judge Christina Ryba ruled in August that Kennedy falsely claimed on his nominating petition that
his ""place of residence"" is an address in Katonah N.Y. outside of New York City where he rents a
spare bedroom rather than his home in California which he purchased in 2021 after marrying
actress Cheryl Hines in 2014.
In a 34-page decision following a short trial Ryba wrote that ""based on clear and convincing
credible evidence"" the New York address listed on the petition ""was not Kennedy's bona fide and
legitimate residence but merely a 'sham' address that he assumed for the purpose of maintaining
his voter registration and furthering his own political aspirations in this State.?

Kennedy?s lawyers told the Supreme Court that Ryba ?did not find that anyone was misled by the
address nor identify any state interests compromised by its use.?And the fact that he's suspended his campaign should not matter his lawyers argued because ""a
suspended campaign is not a terminated campaign.""
""Whether suspending a campaign or only appearing on ballots for some states is a prudent political
strategy is irrelevant to the legal issues in this case"" they wrote. ""The prudence of such a strategy
will be debated by an array of political pundits a flock of history and political science professors and
a chattering of voices on social media.""
Kennedy?s appeal has already been rejected by New York?s highest court and by the New
York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
The Supreme Court asked the New York State Board of Elections and New York Attorney General
Letitia James to respond by Wednesday afternoon.
When Kennedy suspended his campaign he said his name would remain on the ballot and he
encouraged his supporters to vote for him in most states.
But he said he would try to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states ?where my
presence would be a spoiler.?
Kennedy said he does not want to risk handing the election to Democrats ?with whom I disagree on

poll finds
With less than six weeks until the general election former President Donald Trump holds an edge
over Vice President Kamala Harris in the key battleground state of Arizona according to an
exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll.
Trump leads Harris by 6 points 48% to 42% the statewide poll of 500 likely voters found. The poll is
considered within the 4.4% margin of error ? meaning the race is still tight because the margin can
move in either direction by those points for the two candidates. The poll was conducted between
Sept. 21 and 24.
In bellwether Maricopa County the largest county in the state which also typically indicates how the
state will go Trump holds a smaller lead over Harris 47% to 43% according to a separate poll
conducted by the same team over the same period. That figure is within the 5.7% margin of error for
that poll which surveyed an additional 300 likely voters in Maricopa County.
Slightly less than half ? 47% ? of Latino voters in Arizona said they support Harris the statewide poll
found. Trump has the support of 35% of Latinos in the state. Arizona has about 1.3 million eligible
Latino voters roughly a quarter of the state's registered voters.
With 11 electoral votes Arizona is a key battleground state on the pathway to the 270 electoral
votes needed to win the White House. Harris and Trump are vying hard for the state with the Vice
President traveling to Douglas Az. on Friday. Earlier this month Trump held a rally in Tucson. Both
campaigns have also had top surrogates visit the state recently.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.Trump?s lead spells trouble for Harris who initially saw a bump in polling in the state after she
replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket. Biden flipped the state in 2020 winning by
fewer than 11000 votes. Trump in 2016 carried the state. Still the poll found that 5% of those polled
haven't yet made up their minds.
Ana Keck who voted for Biden in 2020 said she will be casting her ballot for Trump this time around
because she believes Democrats have mishandled the economy and foreign policy such as
Russia?s war with Ukraine.
?I just don't think that they've come up with the change that they said that they were going to come
up with? Keck 39 of Scottsdale said of Democrats.
But for Jordan Waddell 30 the protections of women like abortion access as well as LGBTQ+
rights and fears of project 2025 are why she will be supporting Harris.
?We all really need a president who is not focused on hate? said Waddell who lives in Avondale.
?Donald Trump he doesn't understand any of that. And he's not focused on making America better

Majority in Arizona support abortion access poll finds
More than half ? 58% ? of Arizona voters said they will vote yes in supporting Arizona Proposition
139 a Constitutional amendment that provides the fundamental right to abortion in the state.Abortion and reproductive rights have become a key part of Harris? campaign messaging. Last
week Harris called for restoring abortion rights to Georgia following a ProPublica report that Amber
Thurman a 28-year-old pregnant woman died in that state after doctors struggled to grapple with its
new abortion restrictions.
Trump has repeatedly bragged about helping end Roe v. Wade which the Supreme Court
overturned in 2022. He?s said that he wants the states? to decide abortion laws.
Shea Ruskin of Scottsdale will be voting yes to support Arizona?s amendment. The 33-year-old
who was unable to vote in the last election because of voter registration issues will be casting her
ballot this election for Harris.
?I am very concerned about women's rights for the autonomy of their bodies? she said noting that
she does ?see a positive future with? Harris as president.
Keck who is supporting Trump said she is ?pro-choice? and supports the constitutional
amendment.
?I have two daughters. I want them to have a decision? she said adding that abortion is the type of
care also needed for people with health issues or people who have been raped.
And while women?s health is among her top priorities Keck said she would like to see the
discussion widen beyond abortion to include other parts of women?s health like childbirth. In 2017
Keck?s daughter was born at 32 weeks after experiencing a life-threatening pregnancy complication
called HELLP syndrome. Keck and her daughter were in the hospital for two months.?They don't talk about how the number one thing that kills women is childbirth? Keck said. ?What
are they planning to do with that??
Economy inflation among top concerns
Inflation and the economy was the top concern among respondents at 27% according to the poll.
When asked about the economic conditions in Arizona 5% said it was excellent and 26% said it was
good. ""Fair"" and ""poor"" were tied at about 33% each.
Overall a majority ? 52% ? of respondents said they were worse off than they were four years ago
compared to 39% who said they were better off.
Trent Kay a 33-year-old from Gilbert a suburb of Phoenix said he is voting for Trump because he
believes the Republican Party will also be better for the economy. Kay didn?t vote in the last
election saying he didn?t think it mattered as much then.
?Economy is the big one for me. That's the big slider for me? Kay said. ?I don't feel like the other
side has any kind of grasp on what to do with the economy or how to handle foreign policy.?
Waddell the Avondale resident however said Trump is focused on helping the rich rather than
focusing on the middle class.
?The last four years they've been trying to fix what has already happened? she said. ?We can't go
back to what has already happened. It hasn't been economically safe.?Immigration is also top of mind
Immigration is also a key issue for Arizona voters the survey found with 21% of those in this border
state saying it?s their top issue.
Trump has made cracking down on immigration a cornerstone of his campaign saying he will
reimplement his hardline programs as well as new harsher policies such as mass deportations. The
Biden administration has faced criticism for their handling of the border after record levels of

Harris will visit the border in Arizona on Friday where she will speak about border security and push
a bipartisan border security bill that Trump pressured Republicans to kill.

the United States ?vulnerable.?

down-payment assistance for first time-homebuyers he thinks she is the best option among all
those presented by Republicans Democrats and third parties.

65,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Donald Trump suggests undocumented migrants who commit
murders have 'bad genes'
WASHINGTON ? Former President Donald Trump escalated his attack on migrants Monday falsely
suggesting that people who are in the U.S. illegally and commit murder have ""bad genes.""
Trump on Monday criticized Vice President Kamala Harris' work on the U.S. southern border and
immigration proposals in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt
""How about allowing people to come through an open border 13000 of which were murderers""
Trump said.
""Many of them murdered far more than one person and they?re now happily living in the United
States. You know now a murderer I believe this it?s in their genes. And we?ve got a lot of bad
genes in our country right now"" he added.
The former president appeared to be referring to a letter from Immigration and Customs
Enforcement released last month which showed that 13099 people have been convicted of
homicide who are on ICE's ""non-detained docket."" That docket includes various types of immigrants
who entered the country legally and illegally.

Many people in this category are not in custody of immigration authorities because they are in state
or federal prison. In some cases the crimes they are convicted of happened years or decades ago.
Trump's critics quickly pointed out that migrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens andthat Trump has used dehumanizing rhetoric to describe migrants in the U.S. since he entered
politics.
""That type of language is hateful"" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""It's
disgusting it's inappropriate. It has no place in our country.""
The campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris did not comment on Trump's remarks about ""genes.""
Trump has attacked migrants ? and political opponents ? since the day he announced his first
presidential campaign in 2015 and has used dehumanizing terms like ""vermin"" and ""the enemy from
within.""
Trump told a New Hampshire crowd last year that immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally are
""poisoning the blood of our country."" A 2019 USA TODAY analysis of more than five dozen of the
former president's rallies found he had used words like ""invasion"" and ""killer"" to discuss immigrants
at rallies 500 times.

68,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Elon Musk daily $1 million payouts at Trump rally draw legal scrutiny
Jarrett Renshaw
Reuters
Billionaire Elon Musk promised on Saturday to give away $1 million each day until November's
election to someone who signs his online petition with the first prize awarded at a PAC event
supporting Republican Donald Trump raising questions about the legality of the payments.
Musk gave a $1 million check to an attendee of his America PACevent in Harrisburg Pennsylvania
aimed at rallying supporters behind presidential candidate Trump. The winner was a man named
John Dreher according to event staff.
""By the way John had no idea. So anyway you're welcome"" the Tesla founder said as he handed
Dreher the check.
The money is the latest example of Musk using his extraordinary wealth to influence the
tightly-contested presidential race between Trump and his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala
Harris.
Musk started America PAC a political action organization he founded in support of Trump's
presidential campaign. The group is helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states but
there are signs it is having trouble meeting its goals.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.'Deeply concerning'
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Musk?s plan
to give money to registered voters in Pennsylvania is ?deeply concerning? and ?it?s something that
law enforcement could take a look at.?
Questions about the legality of these cash payments abounded on Saturday night as election law
experts pointed to various provisions in federal law that prohibited making cash payments to voters.
It is a federal crime to pay people with the intention of inducing or rewarding them to cast a vote or
to get registered an offense punishable by prison time. The prohibition covers not only monetary
expenditures but also anything of monetary value like liquor or lottery chances a Justice
Department election-crimes manual says.
The Harrisburg event was the third in as many days in Pennsylvania where Musk is painting
November's election in stark terms and encouraging supporters to vote early and get others to do
the same.
He said on Saturday that if Harris wins it will be ""the last election.""
He also said the two assassination attempts against Trump prove he is ruffling feathers and
upending the status quo.
The petition Musk is asking people to sign reads: ""The First and Second Amendments guarantee
freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below I am pledging my support for the
First and Second Amendments.""Attendees of Saturday's event had to sign the petition which allows America PAC to garner contact
details for more potential voters that it can work to get to the polls for Trump.
Musk ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person so far has supplied at least $75 million to
America PAC according to federal disclosures making the group a crucial part of Trump's bid to
regain the White House.
The entrepreneur behind carmaker Tesla and rocket and satellite venture SpaceX has increasingly
supported Republican causes and this year became an outspoken Trump supporter.
Trump in turn has said if elected he would appoint Musk to head a government efficiency
commission.

70,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Falling fertility rates 'childless cat ladies': A deeper look at JD
Vance's comments
Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance has been drawing a lot of attention for his past
statements that Americans should have more kids.
Vance's resurfaced 2021 comments calling Vice President Kamala Harris a ""childless cat lady"" have
gone viral and drawn criticism. Subsequent reports of Vance saying teachers should have their own
kids and cautioning that car seats might be getting in the way of families having more kids have also
resurfaced throughout his campaign. At times Vance has even aligned with one of Harris' campaign
promises to expand the child tax credit as a way to make the country more ""pro-family.""
As global fertility rates fall more countries have turned to policies that encourage families to have
more children an ideal known as pronatalism. But throughout history pronatalist rhetoric and
policies have emerged as part of a backlash to women's rights and immigration often with explicitly
racist tones. Historians who spoke with USA TODAY said a lot of what they hear on the news during
this election cycle sounds familiar.

Fertility rate on the decline; advocates call out rise in pronatalist policies
A recent report from the United Nations shows the global fertility rate is falling down one child per
woman from 30 years ago. More than half of the countries have fertility rates below the rate needed
to prevent population decline.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.UK-based think tank Population Matters advocates for curbing population growth in order to promote
sustainability and human rights. In a 2021 report titled ""Welcome to Gilead"" a nod to the dystopian
story ""The Handmaid's Tale"" the organization said 30% of countries now have pronatalist policies in
place up from 10% in the 1970s.
The report said not all pronatalist policies restrict reproductive rights but that's the case in some
countries including Russia Turkey Poland Iran and China.
Hungary's authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orba?n has touted pro-family economic policies as a
counter to immigration in the face of declining populations according to the Associated Press.
Italy where far-right leader Giorgia Meloni became the country's first woman leader in 2022 has
begun providing stipends for mothers. But Diana Garvin an expert in fascism and Italian politics at
the University of Oregon points out that funding for the program is coming out of the immigration
budget.
""They want to raise the birth rate but it's with ethnic Italians in mind"" Garvin told USA TODAY in an
interview.
Pronatalist intertwined with 'race suicide' movement under Roosevelt
This is not the first time Italy has engaged in pronatalist policies. Garvin explained that under Italy's
fascist rule of the inter-war period women with more than six kids had a better chance at public
housing a ""bachelor tax"" on childless men aged 26 and older targeted gay men and maternal
healthcare was moved under state control.Vance's pronatalist comments are not the first time the movement has appeared in the U.S. either.
University of Pittsburgh history professor Laura Lovett wrote the book on the subject and explained
how pronatalism was a response to immigration in the early 20th century.
""As a historian I've been stunned on how often what I'm hearing in the news is stuff that almost
sounds like it's verbatim from my sources from the 1910s to the 1930s"" Lovett told USA TODAY in
an interview.
The 26th President Theodore Roosevelt was a big proponent of encouraging families to have kids.
He argued it was necessary to avoid ""race suicide"" an idea from eugenicist Edward Ross in which
white native-born Americans would lose in competition to other ethnicities Lovett explained.
While the eugenics movement of that time seemed short-lived Lovett's research shows how the
American Eugenics Society's work rolled over into post-World War II housing development
decisions the racialized effects of which are still having an impact today.
Historians compare childless cat ladies to backlashes on women's rights
Vance isn't the only American public figure who is raising alarm bells on the need to have more kids.
Tech Mogul Elon Musk has reportedly fathered 12 children and touted child bearing as a solution to
a declining global population. But as Trump's running mate Vance's past remarks have taken on
new light as he runs for a more influential office.
Lovett compared Vance's""childless cat ladies"" quip with men from the early 1900s who criticized
women as being more interested in shoes and teddy bears than getting married and having children.(All the while they were fighting for the right to vote.)
Garvin said it reminded her of the flapper panic of the 1920s where society became fearful over
changing gender roles and pointed to urban intellectual women as everything that was wrong with
femininity at the time.
But viral comments aside some similar forces are at play in this election such as immigration and
reproductive rights have been the top-of-mind issues for voters.

News on Tuesday and focus on ?women?s issues? as he tries to win back female voters from his

various issues including the economy abortion immigration and health care. Fox?s Harris
Faulkner will moderate and the show will air Wednesday at 11 a.m. Eastern.
The news comes after Trump recently turned down Fox News and CNN invitations to debate Harris
in mid-October. Although both networks made repeated offers Trump posted in no uncertain terms
on Wednesday ?THERE WILL BE NO REMATCH? on Truth Social. Harris had accepted the CNN
debate but hadn?t responded to FOX?s invite by Thursday?s deadline.
The two presidential candidates debated each other just once when they participated in ABC?s
presidential debate on Sept. 10. Trump insisted he ?won? even though Harris was widely declared

As vice president for nearly four years Harris has already had a chance to address inflation and
take other actions she has promised if elected president but has not done so Monk said.

him at a campaign event in Pennsylvania on July 13.
""Open borders"" are Doyen's greatest fear under a Harris presidency he said. If undocumented
migrants continue to cross the border in large numbers ""how many of those are gang members and
criminals?"" he asked.

hall in September.
""The border issue the immigration groceries"" O'Dea said when asked about her greatest fear of a
Harris presidency.
""This is the first time in my life that I have ever used a calculator while in the grocery store"" and ""it's
obscene"" O'Dea said.
""We love Trump because we want to see America go back to how it was when he was president.""
What Harris supporters told us
Shonda Edgerle 51 of Lapeer Michigan is a team leader at Flint Assembly where General Motors
builds Chevrolet and GMC pickups.
She came out to the Harris rally in Flint to show her support. She said she knows many people who
like her support Harris but are afraid to say so because they don't want to be harassed by Trump
supporters.
She said she fears Trump would attack abortion rights if he wins and pursue an extreme agenda.?I just think it's just scary to me because I'm a big 'Handmaid's Tale' fan but I don't want to live that
life? she said. ?I feel like with the Project 2025 it is to me mirroring that. I'm afraid. I'm really
afraid.""
LaShawn Lenton 53 of Flint Township Michigan worked 13 years as a corrections officer and now
helps manage a senior living community. Her biggest fear about a Trump victory?
?That he would become a dictator and our freedoms would be taken away? she said. ?I have
children and grandchildren. I really believe that when it comes to female rights that we should have
them. I am pro-life. I really am but I feel that no one should control what a woman can do with her
body especially not the government.""
Eugene Behme 66 of Flint is a pipefitter for Chrysler. He said he came to the rally Friday because
he ?wanted a big crowd number to piss off Trump.""
He joked that his biggest fear if Trump wins again is that he'd have to move to Canada. Behme said
Trump's actions on Jan. 6 2021 are more than disqualifying and he fears what will happen if he
gets back in.
""He's got an army. He does have an army of followers. That was obvious with January 6"" Behme
said. ""There are these people this cult that is following his every word. And so if he gets re-elected
his army will be back out onto the streets again what kind of power would he have with this military?
Michigan militia all the militia groups that are out there they're supporting him. It's scary.""
James Logie 27 of Flint has epilepsy and lives on about $1000 a month in disability benefits.Some months his medication costs run $500. He said Harris and President Biden have worked to
lower prescription costs for people like him. He said he worries what would have happened to his
care under Trump.
He said he fears that if Trump wins he will implement a detailed policy plan known as Project 2025.
?I hear a lot about Project 2025 and all the different ways that that can affect everybody as far as
women and their reproductive rights the sales tax? he said. ?And I don't know if there's anything in
there about healthcare but it's it's pretty scary the things I have heard about it.?

75,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Grading College Football Playoff sleepers ... from Indiana to Illinois
Indiana Hoosiers are a College Football Playoff contender and that's no joke. Go ahead Google it.
In the floplympics Mike Norvell leads Lincoln Riley and Hugh Freeze.
When evaluating playoff sleepers Indiana and SMU stand out a bit ahead of the rest.
Coach ?Google Me? saw a spike in search traffic Saturday afternoon.
Indiana?s 56-7 destruction of Nebraska sparked more college football observers to familiarize
themselves with Curt Cignetti the first-year coach of the Hoosiers who?s full of bravado with the
re?sume? to back it up.
?There was a national perception that Nebraska had a pretty legit defense on a national scale?
Cignetti said after the romp. ?So that will open eyes OK??
Consider me wide-eyed.
The Hoosiers are among seven undefeated Power Four teams and although their 7-0 record comes
as a surprise to many it doesn?t to Cignetti who boldly declared this after Indiana hired him: ?It?s
pretty simple. I win. Google me.?
More than halfway through Cignetti?s first season in Bloomington the prospect of his Hoosiers
qualifying for the College Football Playoff generates some Google buzz.
Indiana?s playoff hopes are real for three reasons:1. The schedule breaks nicely. The Hoosiers won?t play fellow the Big Ten?s other undefeated
teams Oregon and Penn State during the regular season. Just one ranked opponent Ohio State
lurks on Indiana?s schedule. The Hoosiers represents the Big Ten?s best chance at a fourth playoff
qualifier and an 11-1 record might entice the CFP committee as long as Indiana doesn?t get
demolished by the Buckeyes.
2. The Hoosiers aren?t just winning. They?re blowing out their competition. So true this win against
No. 25 Nebraska registers as their best win but the selection committee shouldn?t ignore an
average margin of victory of 35 points.
3. No obvious weakness cripples Indiana and veteran quarterback Kurtis Rourke registers as a
trump card.
Cignetti disproved the notion that fans must wait patiently for years while a program turnaround
creeps forward. In this microwave era Cignetti flipped the roster by adding 31 transfers third-most
in the nation. Rourke an Ohio transfer ranked as a premier prize though he is expected to miss
next week's game against Washington due to a hand injury.
Cignetti?s transfer haul included several quality players who followed him off James Madison?s
team that finished 11-2 last season.
If you haven?t by now go ahead and Google Cignetti. You?ll see he?s never had a losing record in
14 seasons as a coach across Division II FCS and FBS. He?s coached three programs into their
respective division?s playoff. His career winning percentage checks in at .783 and he?s not content
with Indiana being a cute October story before fading into basketball season.?I'm not going to let (players) get complacent or the coaches either? Cignetti said. ?I was a maniac
in the fourth quarter of this game a maniac.?
In this case I think being a maniac is a good thing. I?ll Google it to be sure.
MISERY INDEX:Oklahoma tops most miserable fanbase after Week 8
HIGHS AND LOWS:Georgia Alabama headline Week 8 winners and losers
What?s the status of Indiana and some playoff sleepers? Here?s the ?Topp Rope? view:
Evaluating College Football Playoff sleeper teams
Indiana (7-0): Indiana?s schedule could backfire if the bubble overcrowds. The Hoosiers didn?t play
a Power Four nonconference opponent. Games against Western Illinois Charlotte and Florida
International anchor their strength of schedule. Nonetheless when evaluating sleeper teams for the
playoff Indiana?s offensive and defense balance and litany of blowout victories make the Hoosiers
a ? Real contender.
Southern Methodist (6-1): The Mustangs lost by three points to Brigham Young but that?s not a
dealbreaker considering the Cougars are undefeated and might win the Big 12. SMU should be
favored its remaining games opening a pathway to the ACC championship game. Real contender.
Pittsburgh (6-0): Like Indiana Pitt is made vulnerable to snub because of a soft strength of
schedule. Unlike Indiana the Panthers win in white-knuckle fashion. Three wins came by four pointsor fewer. Credit the grit but brace for the second-half wobble against a stiffening schedule that
includes SMU and Clemson. Longshot contender.
Army (7-0): Army?s option offense is a beautiful sight. To have hope of a playoff bid Army needs to
beat Notre Dame win out and a two-loss team winning the Mountain West would assist the cause.
Of note the Army-Navy game on Dec. 14 won?t count toward playoff determination. That presents
as a sticky wicket for the playoff committee. Would it risk placing Army or Navy into the playoff
knowing that either could lose the following week and soil the committee?s selection? Longshot
contender.
Navy (6-0): Sound fundamentals roster retention and player development still resonate. Behold
Army and Navy. Everything I wrote about Army is also true of Navy. The Midshipmen need to beat
Notre Dame run the table and root for a two-loss Mountain West champion. Longshot contender.
Illinois (6-1): Bret Bielema?s return to the Big Ten has been ?borderline erotic? as he would say.
The formula Bielema used to success at Wisconsin also resonates at Illinois. The Illini join Indiana
as basketball schools with a playoff prayer. The trouble for Illinois is it drew a tougher schedule than
Indiana and the Illini are a 21½-point Saturday underdog at Oregon. And a loss effectively
eliminates Illinois making the Illini ? The ultimate longshot.
Battle for the bottom
Alabama fans ready to punt Kalen DeBoer back to Washington take solace: At least the Tide didn?t
hire Mike Norvell. And at least you?re not Auburn.
With five games to go Norvell?s Florida State Seminoles (1-6) already wrapped up the gold forbiggest flop. Fresh off a 13-1 season the ?Noles checked out of the penthouse and into the
outhouse.
In the stall next to them is Southern California (3-4). That the Trojans lost to Penn State was no
disaster but they also own losses to Michigan Maryland and Minnesota. M-M-Mercy.
Lincoln Riley avoided the SEC by jettisoning Oklahoma for USC but he?s found the Big Ten to be
too tough. Perhaps he should relegate back to the Big 12. If you can?t cut it L.A. try Waco Texas.
Monstrous cost-prohibitive buyouts protect Norvell and Riley.
That?s not true of Hugh Freeze who eyes the bronze in bust battle royale.
Auburn (2-5) keeps finding ways to lose. The latest: Missouri marched 95 yards to steal a 21-17
victory. Freeze?s $20-plus million buyout is a fraction what it would cost either Florida State or USC
to make a coaching change and Auburn has a firm stomach for buyouts.
A 2025 recruiting class that ranks No. 5 nationally by 247sports gives Freeze the thinnest layer of
cover. In a time when boosters influence recruiting as much as the coach are some pledged
blue-chippers enough to save a beleaguered coach?
Ask me again next month when we what Auburn?s record is and whether that recruiting class
slipped.
Three and out1. Georgia?s 30-15 upset of Texas boosted the SEC?s quest to horde the most playoff bids. Texas
had been the conference?s last remaining undefeated team and even after defeat the Longhorns
enjoy a navigable path to the playoff while Georgia solidified its footing. Unless the bubble clears
significantly five bids for any conference feels almost out of reach but the result in Austin increased
the SEC?s chance for four bids.
2. Coaches will do almost anything to gain an advantage so how long until a coach reflects on
Saturday?s situation at Missouri and begins campaigning for a hospital to be built next to the
stadium? Missouri quarterback Brady Cook made a midgame hospital trip during the Tigers? win
against Auburn for an MRI on his injured ankle. University Hospital is just across the street from
Faurot Field. Cook had time to get evaluated and return to engineer a fourth-quarter comeback.
?No. 1 characteristic of an elite quarterback is toughness? Missouri coach Eliah Drinkwitz said
?and that guy?s got it written all over him.? And a relevant characteristic of any hospital is its
proximity to you.
3. My latest ?Topp Rope? playoff projection: Georgia (SEC) Ohio State (Big Ten) Clemson (ACC)
Brigham Young (Big 12) Boise State (Group of Five) plus at-large selections Texas Texas A&M
Tennessee Oregon Penn State Notre Dame Miami. Next up: Iowa State LSU Indiana SMU
Kansas State.

76,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Grief devastation await Biden's visit with Helene survivors: Live
updates
Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene's aftermath for Wednesday
Oct. 2. For the latest news view our live updates file for Thursday Oct. 3.
ASHEVILLE N.C. ? President Joe Biden traveled to the Carolinas on a Wednesday tour to survey
devastation from Hurricane Helene as residents across much of the Southeast press on with the
arduous task of rebuilding their shattered communities homes and lives.
Biden visited Greenville South Carolina and later got an aerial view of the extensive damage in
Asheville North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris also made a trip to a highly impacted state
meeting with local officials and first responders in Augusta Georgia.
""I'm here to say the United States ? the nation ? has your back'' Biden said at an emergency
command center in Raleigh alongside North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. ""We're not leaving until
you're back on your feet completely.""
Earlier Wednesday Biden had approved the deployment of up to 1000 active-duty U.S. soldiers to
reinforce North Carolina National Guard members assisting recovery efforts in the state.
The death toll across the Southeast was 181 as of 10 p.m. ET Wednesday based on state and local
reports. Local authorities said they expect the total to rise. Buncombe County home to Asheville
has reported 57 deaths.
Water authorities warned that potable running water could be weeks away in some areas. Duke
Energy said its round-the-clock power-restoration efforts had resolved more than 1.6 millioncustomer outages in the Carolinas. Still almost 900000 homes and businesses remained without
power in the two states Wednesday; another 450000 were dark in Florida Georgia Virginia and
West Virginia.
Hurricane Helene crashed ashore along Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 monster late Thursday.
Its winds died down after landfall but the unrelenting rains overwhelmed a wide swath of the
already-saturated Southeast. Flash flooding from creeks and rivers destroyed homes and
businesses collapsed roads and ripped victims from their families.
As the waters receded the damage to infrastructure grew more apparent.
""We are starting to see some of this damage"" Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton wrote on social
media. ""We had entire substations that were under water.""
Storm tracker:Hurricane Kirk is strengthening and forecast to grow larger NHC says
Developments:
? U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the regional cleanup would be a
""multibillion-dollar undertaking"" and take years to complete.
? USA TODAY published a map of resources in the Asheville area that shows where residents can
find shelter water food and more. The tool is available here.
Harris visits Georgia will also travel to NCHarris visited the Augusta Emergency Operations Center in Georgia where she thanked officials
and emergency personnel for their work in the state's recovery from the impacts of Hurricane
Helene. She also consoled residents of a neighborhood that had toppled trees and debris on the
road.
""It is particularly devastating in terms of the loss of life that this community has experienced the loss
of normalcy and the loss of critical resources"" said Harris who is cutting short her campaign
schedule as the Democratic presidential nominee to travel to some of the heavily affected states.
Harris spoke Tuesday with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer and plans to visit North Carolina in
the coming days to view the damage provide updates on federal response and meet with members
of affected communities the White House said.
""I've been reading and hearing about the work you've been doing over the last few days'' Harris told
officials in Augusta ""and I think it really does represent some of the best of what we each know can
be done especially when we coordinate around local state federal resources to meet the needs of
people who must be seen who must be heard.""

Tennessee company draws probe after workers die in flood
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation opened an inquiry into a plastics manufacturer in Erwin
where several workers were swept away by floodwaters from Helene the Knoxville News Sentinel

three people are missing. Employees of Impact Plastics have alleged management didn?t allow
workers to leave the factory even as warnings were issued and floodwaters from the Nolichucky
River began to swamp the building. The company denies the claim.
The bureau confirmed to The News Sentinel ? known as Knox News part of the USA TODAY
Network ? that District Attorney Steve Finney requested an investigation involving the company but

Water everywhere but not to drink
Access to safe potable water remains a top concern in western North Carolina where about
200000 of the 1 million residents either had no water or low system pressure Wednesday Reuters
reported. In addition more than 1.1 million customers were still without power in the Carolinas and
Georgia as of 6 p.m. ET according to poweroutage.us.
The municipal water supply system in Asheville which serves more than 150000 residents was so
badly damaged by the storm that Assistant City Manager Ben Woody said it would take weeks
before it can pump out water. For now those who are getting water are advised to boil it. .
Water distribution sites have been set up at several locations in ravaged Buncombe County home
to Asheville with supplies provided in a combined effort by local state and federal officials. But the
lack of running water presents a major obstacle to returning to any semblance of normalcy such as
reopening schools.""The biggest concern for getting students back to school is water"" Asheville City Schools
Superintendent Maggie Fehrman said at a news conference Wednesday. ""Without water we just
simply cannot bring students back or staff back into our building.""
CDC offers tips for avoiding post-hurricane dangers
Some of the less-obvious dangers from a hurricane can linger long after the winds have died down.
They include mold and risk of infection from stagnant floodwater which can have bacteria from
overflowing sewage and agricultural and industrial waste according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Here are the CDC's tips for addressing hazards left behind by large storms:
If you do come in contact with floodwater: Wash the area with soap and clean water as soon as
possible. If soap and water aren't available use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer. Take care of
wounds and seek medical attention if needed. Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage
water in hot water and detergent before wearing them again.

baby toys and most paper products. The same goes for drywall and insulation.

Instead use bottled boiled or treated water. Throw away food that may have come in contact with

instead of candles gas lanterns or torches to reduce fire risk. Poisoning deaths from exposure to
carbon monoxide tend to increase after natural disasters like hurricanes and the CDC said they're
already on the rise after Helene. Never use a generator pressure washer or any gas-powered
engine inside a home or garage or less than 20 feet from a door window or vent. Such equipment
emits carbon monoxide which is odorless and colorless and can be fatal.

How to signal you're OK from disaster area
Relatives and friends of those in areas impacted by natural disasters often become anguished when
they can't confirm whether their loved ones in those locations are safe.
Hurricane Helene disrupted power and communications in large swaths of the Southeast and many
communities are still disconnected from the outside world. In some places where internet access is
back power is still out preventing residents from charging their phones and computers.
But for people in affected areas with even fleeting cellular or WiFi connections there are ways to
signal they're all right whether it's by indicating so through their voicemail greeting or on FacebookInstagram or X postings.

Biden sending troops to aid recovery in North Carolina
The soldiers Biden approved being deployed to North Carolina have the manpower and logistical
capabilities to ""get this vital job done and fast"" the president said in a statement.
""These soldiers will speed up the delivery of life-saving supplies of food water and medicine to
isolated communities in North Carolina"" Biden said.
The North Carolina Air National Guard said Wednesday that it had delivered over 100000 pounds
of food water and other critical supplies for Helene victims part of a coordinated relief effort with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Over 760 North Carolina Guard soldiers and airmen have
been assisting with hurricane relief efforts by air and ground conducting search and rescue
missions delivering supplies and clearing roads.

No rest for weary: October historically active for hurricanes
Helene's deadly and devastating rampage across the Southeast last week has eliminated any hope
of a quiet hurricane season for the U.S. There is still plenty of the season left ? it runs through
November ? and ""October is historically an active month particularly in the Caribbean Sea Gulf of
Mexico and off the U.S. Southeast coast"" said Brian McNoldy a hurricane research scientist at theUniversity of Miami's Rosenstiel School. It doesn't take a strong hurricane to cause a lot of damage
McNoldy said.
""A slow-moving disorganized disturbance that maybe doesn't quite become a tropical storm can
unleash feet of rain over an area and create terrible flash flooding"" he said. Rainfall concerns he
added have historically ""taken a back seat to the wind threat in people's minds despite being
deadlier."" Read more here.

Moms 'jump into overdrive' to help
In the mountains of western North Carolina ? one of the areas hit hardest by Hurricane Helene ?
mothers are doing what they do best: taking care of others. Local Facebook groups previously filled
with weekend activity recommendations and hand-me-down clothes offerings are now swamped
with moms ready to go to great lengths to help one another ? even while in dire need themselves.
They're sharing formula and baby wipes. They're giving away their kids' books and toys. They're
offering cribs mattresses meals. One mom even offered her frozen breast milk. Kate Patterson the
mother of two young children has spent the past few days going door-to-door conducting wellness
checks on people living in remote rural areas around Boone.
""You just see the need and you do it"" she said. ""There's no sitting around waiting. You just jump

Biden pledges federal support
Biden visited with officials and first responders in the Carolinas on Wednesday before heading to
Georgia and Florida on Thursday the White House said. Biden pledged to ""build back better and
stronger"" areas destroyed by Helene.
""The Biden-Harris administration is here'' he tweeted early Wednesday. ""And we're not leaving until
the job's done.""
Vice President Kamala Harris visited Georgia on Wednesday and has said she will also visit North
Carolina soon. Former President Donald Trump went to Georgia on Monday.
New storm system could target battered Gulf Coast
A tropical disturbance expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico could become a tropical depression
by the end of the week or the weekend according to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane
Center.
After that it's still too early to tell where it will go or how much it will strengthen but the NHC and
other forecasters say that even if the system doesn't develop into a named storm ""locally heavy rain
could hit portions of the Florida peninsula by the weekend.""
AccuWeather warned Florida ""may be the prime target"" for any budding system next week.Also churning in the Atlantic basin is Hurricane Kirk as well as a tropical wave south of the Cabo
Verde Islands. Kirk is expected to become a major hurricane by Thursday but isn't forecast to pose
a threat to the U.S. The tropical wave is forecast to become a tropical depression in a few days
while it moves slowly westward. Its destination remains unclear.

77,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Hand counting a court fight and a QAnon follower: 3 counties to
watch in 2024 election
In county governments across the country officials who fear elections are vulnerable to fraud have
been taking matters into their own hands lodging protests and investigations.
Many have delayed and voted against certifying elections since former President Donald Trump
falsely claimed his 2020 loss was due to voter fraud. In Nevada a commissioner of a key swing
county said she learned information that warranted ""further investigation."" In Mohave County
Arizona a commissioner who voted to delay a certification vote said it was a statement of solidarity
with other counties that were delaying certification. In Michigan two members of a county board of
canvassers in the Upper Peninsula didn't believe three recall elections all could have had a similar
margin.
An official in Colorado breached her own county?s voting machines and another in Ohio was
investigated for a potential attempted breach.
Then there are counties that attempt to replace machine-counting ballots with having humans
hand-count their ballots a practice that studies show is less accurate and timely than using
machines.
Some of these counties are in key swing states or blue states where Vice President Kamala Harris
is dependent on electoral votes to win.

The key role of countiesIn most states counties run elections. Boards such as a county commission a board of elections or
specialized boards may choose the top election official in the county decide on basic administrative
issues and formally sign off on election results.
States have sued counties and grand juries have indicted county officials when they don't certify
elections. Officials usually comply with court orders or reverse their votes quickly. But the fight over
what counties can do still has the potential to sow chaos and distrust in elections.
?There are just so many layers where people could decide not to follow the rules as written"" Rick
Hasen a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who runs ElectionLawBlog.org said.
Here?s a look at three swing-state counties where officials have created controversy over elections
and how they could affect the presidential election.
Spalding County Georgia
Donald Trump won with about 60% of the votes in 2020 in this rural county an hour?s drive south of
Atlanta.
On Oct. 8 three Republican-leaning appointees on the five-member Board of Elections ? Ben
Johnson Roy McClain and James Newland ? voted to perform a hand-count audit of how many
ballots were cast in one federal and one local race. They will choose names out of a hat to decide
which elections to hand count as a way of checking the results against the machine-counted ones.
The nationwide push toward hand-counting among election integrity activists on the right followsdebunked rumors that voting machines and tabulation machines were somehow rigged in the 2020
presidential election such as the debunked claim that Dominion Voting Systems used an algorithm
to flip votes from Trump to Biden.
Election experts endorse machine-counting ballots using scanners similar to those used in
standardized tests because of cost and practicality. ?Hand counts can have error rates up to 50
times higher than vote-counting machines? the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice wrote in
July saying that hand-counting is only practical in counties with under 1000 voters.
The Spalding County Election Board had a 3-2 Democratic-leaning majority during the 2020
election. But Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger a Republican and the county?s
Republican state house delegation criticized the county?s election supervisor that year for issues
with getting ?voting systems up and running? in the early morning on Election Day and forcing
people to use provisional ballots which they said are processed differently from other ballots.
The state legislature's Republican majority in 2021 passed a law that specifically changed who
appoints certain board members in Spalding County and the eligibility for someone to be the county
election supervisor effectively handing Republicans a 3-2 majority on the board and terminating the
election supervisor.
In 2022 election workers found a fraudulent ballot inserted into a tabulation machine according to
the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The secretary of state?s office told the newspaper the ballot ?may
have been created to add a vote for some candidates or may have been an attempt to cast doubt
on the integrity of election systems across the state.?
Johnson who called the 2020 presidential election ?majorly questionable? is the current boardchairman. He also shared Instagram posts that align with the QAnon conspiracy theory ?
condemning ?high-profile pedophiles? referencing a satanic death cult and a photoshopped picture
of the so-called QAnon shaman.
Efforts to reach Johnson and McClain were unsuccessful. A person who answered a number listed
for Newland hung up immediately. USA TODAY did not receive responses to emails sent to the full
board to election Supervisor Kimberly Slaughter and to a generic email for the elections office.
USA TODAY also left a voicemail for the county manager.
?We?ve spent the last two years really trying to work in a cooperative manner so as not to make
Spalding County this hot spot for election controversies but somehow Spalding County continues to
be at the forefront of election controversy? said Dexter Wimbish a Democrat on the board of
elections.
Wimbish said he thinks if there is a big difference between the hand count and the machine count
his colleagues may seek to hand count all the races and do away with voting machines. He said he
is ""very much concerned"" that if the board's reasonable inquiry into results prompts in an
investigation and that investigation is not completed on time ""there will be a vote not to certify the
election.""
""I think it?s about the possibility of throwing the presidential election into litigation if their candidate
of choice is not elected"" he said. ""I think clearly that?s what it?s designed to do.""
Fulton County Pennsylvania
This rural county of 15000 in south-central Pennsylvania sits on the border of Maryland and hasbeen described by Reuters as ""Trump Country"" because it votes overwhelmingly for the former
president.
County commissioners who also serve as the county Board of Elections have been in a legal battle
with the secretary of state's office for years after they were accused of bringing in a technology
company in December 2020 to breach their Dominion voting machines in order to audit the election
results.
The secretary of state's office decertified the machines because the company had taken pictures of
critical components of the machines compromising their use in future elections. Fulton County took
the state to court challenging the secretary of state's power to decertify the machines.
The county was so adamant about investigating the machines that the county tried to bring in a
second company to inspect the equipment according to court documents. So the state got an order
from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to stop the second company from being allowed to inspect.
""Months later ? and with no public consideration official proceedings or notice to the courts or other
parties to this litigation"" Fulton County brought in a third company to inspect the machines the court
wrote. The secretary of state's office asked to hold the county in contempt and impose sanctions.
The judge concluded in 2023: ?Fulton County and its various attorneys have engaged in a
sustained deliberate pattern of dilatory obdurate and vexatious conduct and have acted in bad
faith throughout these sanction proceedings.?
Randy Bunch one of two commissioners who brought the case against the secretary of state's
office was re-elected in 2023 and is currently the chairman of the three-person board. He did notrespond to inquiries from USA TODAY. Neither did commissioners Steven Wible or Hervey Hann
who were elected in 2023.
""The department will not hesitate to act if any of the 67 counties of the commonwealth acts in a
manner that jeopardizes the safety and security of the votes cast this November by its citizens""
wrote Pennsylvania Department of State Press Secretary Matt Heckel in an email. He said the
county's actions related to voting systems were ""reckless.""
Bunch Wible and Hann will be responsible for certifying the county's results of the presidential
election.
Cochise County Arizona
This red county in the southeastern corner of Arizona has a 2-1 Republican majority on its county
governing board and has tussled with Democratic state officials multiple times since 2020 over how
they administer elections.
Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd two Republicans on the Board of Supervisors are under indictment
for conspiracy and interference with an election officer because they did not certify the results of the
Nov. 8 2022 election prior to a state deadline.
Crosby and Judd both supported ordering a hand count of more ballots on top of a small sample
that the state already requires them to do before certifying the vote. A court later that year ordered
the board to certify and Judd and Democrat Ann English voted to do so but Crosby did not attend
the vote. Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes? office brought the case to a grand jury.
The trial starts in January.Judd declined to comment for this story. Crosby pointed to his public comments in meetings.
Meeting minutes from Nov. 18 2022 show Crosby said he had no reason to think the 2020 election
was dishonest but said certification should be delayed until there was more evidence that proved the
machines were reliable.
?While he does not know he suspects that voting machines can be hacked? the minutes say.
Cochise County Recorder David Stevens a Republican whose office maintains voter registration
records told USA TODAY he was willing to perform the hand count for the board. ?I?m the kind of
guy who likes to help? he said pointing to his time in the Army and the Boy Scouts.
Stevens declined to say whether President Joe Biden was legitimately elected instead saying he?s
looking forward. He said he expects to accept the results of the upcoming presidential election. ?I
have no reason not to? he said. ?But I can?t speak to what happens in the future.?
English the Democratic supervisor said she doesn?t think her colleagues have considered bringing
up hand counting again and she was hopeful the presidential results would be certified.
?In life you make mistakes and that?s where lessons are learned so I?m hoping that they learned
that lesson? she said.","USA TODAY_Hand_counting,_a_court_fight_and_a_QAnon_follower_.pdf.pdf",news_articles
78,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Harris heads to southern border in Arizona ? where she's losing
ground to Trump
WASHINGTON ? Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris heads Friday to the U.S.-Mexico
border in Arizona looking to recharge her candidacy in a key battleground state where she is losing
ground to former President Donald Trump.
Harris' trip to Douglas Arizona ? about 120 miles southeast of Tucson Arizona and home to the
state's second busiest port of entry ? comes as a new poll released Friday by USA TODAY/Suffolk
University found Trump leading Harris by 6 percentage points 48%-42% among likely Arizona
voters. The difference is within the poll's plus or minus 4.4% margin of error.
Harris will deliver a speech at the border calling for tougher border restrictions according to a senior
Harris campaign official who discussed the trip on the condition of anonymity.
In her remarks she is expected to slam Trump for encouraging Republican senators earlier this year
to kill a bipartisan border bill backed by the Biden administration that included tough new restrictions
for asylum seekers and additional resources for Border Patrol agents. Harris has accused Trump of
lobbying for the bill's defeat because he realized it would ""fix a problem he wanted to run on.""
But Trump has hammered Harris on the Biden administration's immigration policies and her role in
addressing root causes of migration to the southern border. Immigration a growing issue for voters
has been a weak area for Democrats and Harris.

""The worst border crisis in the history of the world"" Trump said Thursday in New York. ""And thearchitect is Kamala Harris.""

In 2020 President Joe Biden narrowly carried Arizona ? which has 11 electoral votes up for grabs ?
by less than 11000 voters over Trump. It was the first time Arizona voted for a Democratic
presidential nominee since Bill Clinton carried the state in 1996.
But the USA TODAY/Suffolk poll found Harris trails Trump 47%-43% in Maricopa County a
bellwether and largest county in the state that includes Phoenix. In 2020 Biden carried Maricopa
County 50%-48%. Trump's current polling lead over Harris in Maricopa County is within the 5.4%
margin of error.
Latino support for Harris in Arizona lagging behind
It?s the latest sign that Harris is struggling to maintain momentum she gained in Arizona after taking
the torch from Biden as the Democratic nominee this summer. On Monday a new poll by the New
York Times and Siena College showed Trump up by 5 points 50%-45% in Arizona. A Real Clear
Politics average of recent polls has Trump ahead of Harris by 1.6 percentage points.
Trump campaigned at the U.S.-Mexico border last month in Sierra Vista Arizona. Harris previously
visited the southern border during a 2021 trip to El Paso Texas.
Immigration ? historically a losing issue for Democrats in elections ? remains a liability for Harris
even as she's gone on offense by emphasizing Trump's role in defeating the bipartisan border bill.
The Harris campaign is also set to release a new television ad that will begin airing Friday in Arizonaand other battleground states that says Harris will ""secure our border"" as president.
A USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll this month found likely voters by a 50%-47% margin
believe Trump would do a better job handling immigration than Harris A Quinnipiac University poll
this week found Trump with a wider 53%-45% edge on immigration.

Although the Harris campaign has focused efforts to galvanize Latino voters in key battlegrounds
like Arizona Nevada and Pennsylvania the vice president?s support among Latinos in Arizona is
lagging behind the national level.
Less than half ? 47% ? of Latino voters in Arizona said they support Harris according to the USA
TODAY/Suffolk poll. Trump has the support of 29% of Latinos in the state the poll found. Arizona
has around 1.3 million eligible Latino voters accounting for about one-quarter of the state's
electorate.
Nationally Harris holds a larger lead among Latino voters 57% compared to Trump at 39%
according to a report from Pew Research.

The claim: Video shows Kamala Harris said 'next question' to avoid CNN question on economy
A Sept. 25 Instagram post (direct link archive link) shows Vice President Kamala Harris being
interviewed by CNN's Dana Bash.
""I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy specifically
because their groceries were less expensive housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was
president"" Bash asks Harris in the video.
In the clip Harris responds ""Next question please.""
The post's caption reads ""Always deflecting the questions.""
The post was liked more than 2000 times in a day.
More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook
page
Our rating: Altered
The clip is deceptively edited. Videos and a transcript of the August interview posted by CNN show
Harris did not say ""next question"" to Bash's question about the economy. Harris made the remark at
a different point in the interview in response to a question about her race.
Video misleads by splicing separate interview moments togetherThe clip in the Instagram post shows Harris and her running mate on the Democratic presidential
ticket Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sitting down with Bash CNN's chief political correspondent for an
interview that aired Aug. 29.
But video of the interview posted by CNN shows the clip in the post was altered to change Harris'
answer to Bash's question about voters and the economy. Harris did not deflect the question by
saying ""Next question please."" Rather Harris said she and President Joe Biden inherited an
economy that ""had crashed"" because of Trump's ""mismanagement"" of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The video and a CNN transcript of the exchange show Harris went on to say in part:
""When we came in our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today we
know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America
recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices in particular for
groceries are still too high. The American people know it. I know it. Which is why my agenda
includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example dealing with an
issue like price gouging.""
Fact check: Biden Harris net worth nowhere near viral post's claim
Harris did make the ""next question"" remark in the interview but it came in response to a question
about comments Trump had made about Harris' racial identity. Here's how that exchange played
out according to the transcript:
""BASH: Speaking of Republicans I want to ask you about your opponent Donald Trump. I was alittle bit surprised people might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him met
him face to face. That?s gonna change soon but what I want to ask you about is what he said last
month. He suggested that you happened to turn Black recently for political purposes questioning a
core part of your identity. HARRIS: Yeah. BASH: Any? HARRIS: Same old tired playbook. Next
question please. (LAUGH) BASH: That?s it? HARRIS: That?s it.
CNN video of the exchange makes it clear this was the portion of the interview used in the altered
clip to make it seem as if Harris dismissed Bash's question about the economy.

Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Monday September 30th 2024. This is The Excerpt.
Today we have the latest on the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Plus Election Day is
right around the corner. We'll discuss a project that looks at seven key battlegrounds and how
Native voices are offering travelers a chance to see beyond the scenery.
?
The death toll has risen past 90 across multiple states in the days since Hurricane Helene made
landfall in Florida on Thursday as a historic category four storm. And more than 2 million peopleremained without power late yesterday across the Southeast that included nearly half a million in
North Carolina where the storm destroyed homes trapped residents spawned landslides and sunk
communities under floodwaters. Hundreds of roads were washed away cellular service for over
250000 people was cut off and swaths of cities including Asheville were left underwater. The
state's governor Roy Cooper said Helene had become one of the worst storms in modern history
for parts of North Carolina.
Many communities across Eastern Tennessee were still underwater and coping with crumbled
roads unsteady bridges and devastated utility systems yesterday. The remnants of Helene brought
rivers to record levels and forced evacuations. Schools remain closed across several counties as
well. The US has averaged eight yearly disasters that caused more than a billion dollars in damage
since 1980. But in the last five years the number of such catastrophes has more than doubled to
18. Helene is only the latest with the cost of its damage estimated at between $15 billion and $100
billion. You can read more from the storm's aftermath on usatoday.com.

Hamas says an Israeli airstrike killed its leader in Lebanon earlier today. The militant group said
Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine was killed along with his wife son and daughter in a strike that targeted
their house in a refugee camp in a southern part of the country. Another group The Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine said three of its leaders were killed in a strike targeting a Beirut
district. The strike against the group hit the upper floor of an apartment building according to
Reuters witnesses. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
The latest strikes come after Israel killed Hezbollah's veteran leader Hassan Nasrallah last week.
Exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border have been taking place almost daily since thewar between Hamas and Israel launched nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it was acting in
solidarity with Hamas. Violence along the border has escalated in recent weeks and Lebanon's
Health Ministry says more than 1000 Lebanese have been killed and 6000 wounded in the past
two weeks. The government says a million people representing a fifth of the population have fled
their homes.

Tomorrow marks five weeks until Election Day in America and though 50 states will vote seven
battlegrounds likely will decide the next president. The USA TODAY network team traveled to seven
counties one in each swing state whose voters will play a pivotal role in determining whether
former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris wins their state and ultimately the
presidency. I spoke with Des Moines Register News Director and Politics Editor Mike Trautmann to
learn more about the project. Mike it is so good having you on. Thanks for making the time.
Mike Trautmann:
I appreciate it.
Taylor Wilson:
So Mike would you just start by telling us a bit about this seven counties project? How many
reporters did we have where'd they go and what made you pick these particular counties to zoom
in on this election?
Mike Trautmann:We had almost a dozen reporters but we had more photographers and videographers. Between
everybody we probably have three dozen or more people from the network working on this thing to
really pinpoint the places that are going to make the big difference in this presidential election. And
there are seven states that will most likely decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is elected
in November Georgia North Carolina Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin Nevada and Arizona.
We have newsrooms in each one of those sites and we have experienced reporters that were able
to really look at the places within those states that are going to be the swing counties in those swing
states.
Cabarrus County in North Carolina right on the outskirts of Charlotte. Richmond County in Georgia
where there's concerns about whether the elections will be held in a way that the voters will believe
the results. Washoe County in Nevada the purplest of the purplest counties in a purple state and
they could go either way. The list goes on and on. But the idea was to find the key points in each
state that could be a microcosm to show the bigger issue of how it could all come down in
November and what the voters who are there say is important to them when they cast their ballots.
Taylor Wilson:
And Mike what did your team hear from voters about the big issues influencing their election
choice? Did they mostly have the same concerns?
Mike Trautmann:
A lot of the same concerns that you probably have heard over the last few months inflation the
economy border security abortion reproductive rights the importance of election integrity andprotecting our democracy. I think what was different is that these were people by and large we
were able to key in on who are not your political junkies.
They're not your people watching CNN and Fox and MSNBC 24 hours a day keying in on every
change or every last thing that are said by politicals. These are people who are going about their
lives but there's a few things that make a big difference to how they're going to cast their ballots.
Taylor Wilson:
And what did reporters hear from that small sliver of voters Mike who were undecided coming into
this fall? What were they hoping to see that would make them go one way or another?
Mike Trautmann:
I think a lot of them are leaning one direction or another. They maybe are not truly undecided. They
have a feeling about which way they want to go and depending on where you are that feeling is
either towards Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. I think what they are looking to see is something to
reassure them that where they're leaning is the right way.
And for each of them it's different. We heard a couple in Arizona who talked very much about the
importance of leaning towards Kamala Harris because of their belief in her character and the
treating of people right. We heard from a couple in Nevada who just thinks life was better under
Trump and they want to go back to that time.
Taylor Wilson:Was there one big takeaway that you can share with our listeners Mike?
Mike Trautmann:
I think the big takeaway is that this really is going to be a knife's edge election. We suspected that
going in. This really is going to be a fight to the last day for the last vote. And I think this just shows
that this is not voters who hate the other side these are people who just want their lives to be better
and they think that one candidate or another is going to help them get to that place and they are
really evenly divided.
Taylor Wilson:
So Mike we don't have any more presidential debates but we've got the VP debate tomorrow
night. Do you anticipate that undecided voters in these seven counties might be swayed at all by
that event?
Mike Trautmann:
I think what we can expect from that is that they will look for affirmation again that these messages
these voices these representatives of the presidential candidates reflect what they are thinking is
the way they want to go. So is JD Vance going to tell them something that says ""Yeah Trump's my
guy. JD's saying the same thing I'm voting for Trump"" or is it going to be Tim Walz echoing the
joyful warrior message of Kamala Harris that says ""Yeah I feel good about this election. He's
saying the same things I'm expecting to hear from Kamala. I'll cast my vote for Kamala""? I don't
think that either one of them by themselves will say anything that will make somebody change their
vote. I think it'll be something that cements their vote.Taylor Wilson:
All right. Mike Trautmann is the News Director and Politics Editor for the Des Moines Register part of
the USA TODAY network. Thank you Mike.
Mike Trautmann:
Appreciate it. Stay tuned for the project. I think everybody will be very happy with it.

Taylor Wilson:
The Major League Baseball regular season is in the rearview mirror almost. With the postseason
set to begin tomorrow there are still two places left to be decided the final wild-card spots in the
National League. The Atlanta Braves New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks are all tied. But
the Mets and Braves still have their final games which will be played today as a double-header after
Helene washed away the scheduled games last week. If the Braves and Mets split the games both
will make the playoffs and Arizona will miss out. If either team wins both games that team and the
Diamondbacks will be in the loser will be out. If you need any help following we have a link in
today's show notes and the opening round of the playoffs is set to begin tomorrow.

While America's picturesque landscapes are celebrated for their beauty and grandeur they oftenhold deeper significance as the ancestral homelands of Native tribes. Through guided experiences
and cultural storytelling indigenous voices are sharing the history and connection to these lands
offering travelers a chance to see beyond the scenery. I spoke with USA TODAY consumer travel
reporter Eve Chen for more. Eve thanks for hopping on today.
Eve Chen:
Thanks for having me.
Taylor Wilson:
So Eve would you just start by telling us about some of the cultural teachers and educators you
spoke with for this story and the work they're doing?
Eve Chen:
Over the summer I had the opportunity to take an Adventures by Disney trip through Arizona and
Utah. And one of the big things about Adventures by Disney is they really connect people and
places through stories. A lot of these storytellers on our trip were Native American specifically
Navajo and Hopi because they are among the tribes that are deeply historically tied to the lands that
we were visiting. When we were at the Grand Canyon one of the cultural educators who came and
interacted with us was named Albert Brent Chase. He was telling stories and performing traditional
flute and interacting with dancers as he was sharing his culture and heritage with us. But his real
focus is actually preserving and sharing Navajo culture both within his own community and outside.
So he's been developing curriculum to keep traditions alive with the youth that can be taught
through the Navajo school system but he's also sharing with non-Navajo peoples.And he covered a whole gamut of topics in between the stories and songs and the dances as well.
He talked about basket weaving. He talked about Navajo code talkers. He talked about Native
American representation in Hollywood. And he did this in a very conversational easy approachable
way in a way that we could feel comfortable asking him questions and connecting with him and
learning more about the culture itself in an easy inviting setting. Now there were several other
different Navajo and Hopi tribal members who we got to interact with throughout the course of the
trip. There was a Hopi guide who took us through parts of the Grand Canyon and told us about the
stories there from his culture. Probably one of the most remarkable moments though was in
Monument Valley which is within Navajo Nation. It's a place that people have probably seen in
Hollywood films like Forrest Gump and even the EPCOT and Disney California retro ride Soarin'.
They've seen the historic and iconic buttes of Red Rock in the land but the place itself is on Navajo
land. In the evening we had a chance to hear some performances from a Native American band
named Dark Sky. One of the band members Don Mose III talked about the importance of the place
to him personally but also to the Navajo people. He's from that area in Monument Valley and he
just talked about how as beautiful as it is it's also a place of great spiritual connection. It's a sacred
place for his people. He was so happy to see travelers excited to learn more about his culture and
he just wants to see more of that.
Taylor Wilson:
What's really the connection Eve between national parks and indigenous peoples on this
continent?
Eve Chen:So National Park Service Director Chuck Sams who is in fact Native American himself has said
all national parks are located on indigenous ancestral lands. So they are implicitly tied together. And
the opportunity to see the lands from a Native perspective is so important because you're able to
see the history of the place not just the place itself not just a scenery but know who the people are
that were there and who continue to live to this day.
A lot of Native Americans that I've spoken with covering multiple stories through the years they say
""Sometimes people forget that we're still here. Our cultures are still vibrant and alive. We're not just
something from the history books."" Even if they're no longer in national parks some are but even
though they're no longer necessarily physically living in the spaces that are now national parks
they're still vibrant and having cultures that they want to share and there are opportunities to do so.
Taylor Wilson:
How do the national parks recognize the people whose land they're on and how might they still fall
short? Why is it so important for Native storytellers to really lead the way here?
Eve Chen:
So national parks have been making a concerted effort to share more stories of historically
marginalized peoples including Native Americans. And most national parks have an
acknowledgement on their website of the different tribes that are historically connected to that land.
For instance the Grand Canyon has 11 different tribes and you can go on their websites and see
which ones Hopi and Napa are among them.However actually interacting with Native Americans is not something that happens at every single
national park. Some parks like Glacier Glacier Bay and Yellowstone have created places and
programs specifically for that opportunity where not only the Native Americans who are traditionally
tied to the land can go and do their cultural practices but also intersect with visitors who may want
to learn more about their cultures.
There's an organization called the American Indian Alaska Native Tourism Association. Now even
though Native Hawaiian isn't part of that name it is the actual organization for all of those groups.
It's also known as AIANTA. And they have a consumer-facing website called nativealaska.travel.
Travelers who are interested in Native-led experiences all across the country can go there and plug
in the geography that they're looking for what kind of experiences they're looking for and find out
more about the different Native-led travel companies that are offering these types of experiences.
Taylor Wilson:
All right. Eve Chen covers consumer travel for USA TODAY. Thank you Eve.

Four days in 2020
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 presented election officials and voters with a slew of new
challenges.
States worked to expand access to voting while the country was reeling from the airborne virus and
instituted or extended early voting and absentee ballots. This in many ways made it easier to vote
for people who may not have had the time or means of getting to the polls beforehand on top of the
restrictions and fears during the pandemic.
Despite the often easier access to voting in 2020 counting these ballots was a different story.
In many states early voting ballot counting could not start until Election Day and others could start
as early as 18 days but results could not be disclosed until polls were closed.
In the 2020 election the high number of voters (46%) using absentee or mail-in ballots led to
millions of backlogged ballots nationwide according to the Pew Research Center. This caused
delays in reporting results in several swing states and provided an opportunity for Trump and his
supporters to spread election fraud conspiracies.
It took four days for all of the votes to be counted resulting in Joe Biden's victory on Nov. 7.

plan he had to do it
Paul addressed what led up to the plan that he never attempted. His parents divorced when he was
7 and older brother Logan was 9 and it was ?by all accounts an ugly split? according to The
Hollywood Reporter. His boorish behavior got him sued by his landlord and fired by Disney. And in
late 2017 Logan visited ?suicide forest? in Japan filmed a suicide victim and posted the footage on
YouTube.
?I got lumped into all my brother?s hate? Jake Paul said. ?It was like ?(Expletive) the Pauls.
(Expletive) both of those people.? It was bad. The suicide forest thing basically ruined my career
and income. I lost probably $30 million in deals. There was one $15 million deal for retail products
that fell apart. They were able to get out of it because of a morality clause.?
It led to problematic behavior Jake Paul said.
?Basically life hit me in the face and it was like ?Who are you? What have you been doing the
past couple of years?? ? he said. ?It led to drinking and drugs and Los Angeles and going to parties
and just that whole entire world. I got sucked up into it really quickly.?
Jake Paul continued: ?And so there I am: No money kind of hating myself the whole world hates
me. I?m drinking. I?m depressed and not having a good relationship with either of my parents or
Logan. ?I just felt wrong in life and by all the cards I had been dealt. It was (expletive up). I just tried
to do good my whole life and here I am with what felt like nothing?

seven knockouts and also co-founded Most Valuable Promotions which manages a stable of
fighters that include Amanda Serrano a multiple-time world champion.

89,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Joe Biden returns to a beleaguered Florida to survey Hurricane Milton
damage in Tampa area
ST. PETE BEACH ? Returning to a beleaguered state battered by back-to-back hurricanes
President Joe Biden landed in Florida Sunday to again survey the damage from a major storm and
rally federal resources around a recovery effort that likely will take years and billions of dollars.
Biden was in Florida just 10 days earlier to assess the impact of Hurricane Helene which made
landfall in the Big Bend region as a Category 4 storm before cutting a swath of destruction north
through Georgia North Carolina and other states.
The president headed back to Florida after Hurricane Milton made landfall Oct. 9 on Siesta Key as a
Category 3 storm delivering a second powerful blow. Nearly a million electric utility customers still
were without power in Florida Sunday morning and gasoline shortages persist.
After arriving at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa Biden toured damaged areas by helicopter met
with state and local officials greeted residents impacted by the storms and first responders. He also
spoke to the media in front of a collapsed home in St. Pete Beach a barrier island community
inundated by storm surge.
?We?re going to do everything we can to get power back in your home not only helping you recover
but to help you build back stronger"" Biden said.
Between Helene and Milton much of the West Coast of Florida ? from the small coastal towns of
Steinhatchee and Cedar Key down through the heavily populated Tampa Bay region Sarasota and
points south ? has experienced extensive storm damage. Milton also battered parts of central
Florida and the East Coast.More than 200 people died in Helene across multiple states and at least 17 in Milton.
Storm surge flooding devastated coastal areas. Some regions also have extensive wind damage
including from a rash of tornados spawned by Milton and flooding from heavy rains.
The hurricanes also brought political fights as Republicans led by former President Donald Trump
accused the Biden administration of not doing enough to help storm victims prompting fierce
pushback from the president as Election Day approaches in three weeks.
Such disasters should be moments for bipartisan cooperation Biden said Sunday.
?It?s in moments like this we come together to take care of each other not as Democrats and
Republicans but as Americans"" he said. ""Americans who need help and Americans who would
help you if you were in the same situation. We are one United States.?
Among those greeting Biden in Florida were Republicans U.S. Sen. Rick Scott and U.S. Rep. Anna
Paulina Luna. Biden later told reporters that he didn't speak with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis during his
visit.
""Republicans and Democrats are happy with what we?re doing"" Biden said. ""We?re making
progress.?
DeSantis' emergency management director Kevin Guthrie attended the St. Pete Beach event.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said DeSantis was invited to participate in theevents with Biden Sunday but the White House didn't hear back.
""The White House press secretary is incorrect"" DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern said in
response. ""Director Kevin Guthrie was there representing Governor DeSantis. The Division of
Emergency Management is part of the Executive Office of the Governor. Therefore President Biden
heard directly from the governor?s office.""
Asked why DeSantis didn't attend himself Redfern said Guthrie ""is the governor?s designated
representative.""
Before Biden?s trip Sunday the White House sent media outlets a long list of actions taken before
and after both hurricanes to get federal resources to affected communities.
Biden noted that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delivered 1.2 million meals
more than 300000 liters of water and 2 million gallons of fuel while installing 100 satellite terminals
to restore communications. The federal government has opened 10 disaster recovery centers in
Florida with more to come he added noting more than 250000 people registered for federal
disaster help the day before his trip.
And while many Floridians remain without power more than 2 million have seen their power
restored in recent days by utility workers from 43 states and Canada Biden said.
The president also announced funding Sunday to help with future storms ? $614 million in federal
grants to communities to improve their electric grids including $94 million for Florida.
Storm debris was piled high in the streets surrounding where Biden spoke Sunday in St. PeteBeach. The contents of many people's homes and businesses were ruined by storm surge from the
Gulf and tossed on the curb everything from mattresses to dressers chairs and filing cabinets.
Most businesses were closed and many were still boarded up. One business had signs outside
painted on what appeared to be mattress box springs reading ""Mr. President Small Business Needs
Help"" and ""Family Owned Since 1988 and Devasted.""
Part-time St Pete Beach resident Paul Giardina was happy to see the president in town saying he
hopes it speeds recovery efforts. Giardina lives in one-story condo building with seven units near
where Biden spoke. His property which is just a short walk to the Gulf was spared significant
damage from both Helene and Milton.
Helene sent about half an inch of water into the building ruining a bed rugs and other items. Milton
tore off roof shingles. But Giardina was grateful the storms didn?t do more damage noting a house
behind him lost the roof and a condo building next door had more than 3 feet of water inside.
?We were the lucky ones? he said.
Giardina lives in Lenox Massachusetts during the summer where he owns an excavating
business. He has wintered in St. Pete beach for the last six years with two brothers three cousins
and a friend in the same condo building they purchased together.
He arrived in Florida one day after Helene to check on the property paying a teenager $50 to give
him a ride on a jet ski to the island community. While his property weathered both storms well the
overall community was devastated.?It?s pretty horrifying? Giardina said. ?Like a war zone anything within two blocks of the beach.?
St. Pete Beach is in Pinellas County where Cathi Perkins works as emergency management
director. About half of county electric customers who lost power after Milton have been restored she
said as she walked down the street toward the empty lot where Biden spoke.
The community is tired and frustrated Perkins said but it?s encouraging to know more help is on
the way.
?We?re just very grateful that both the state and federal governments are here to help us and
provide us with resources? Perkins added. ?I think it means a lot to people to see that we?re not
alone.?",USA TODAY_Joe_Biden_returns_to_a_beleaguered_Florida_to_surv.pdf.pdf,news_articles

interview before election
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris could sit down with popular podcaster Joe Rogan
for an interview in the final stretch of the U.S. presidential campaign three sources with knowledge
of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Harris campaign officials met with Rogan?s team this week but an appearance has not been
confirmed yet two of the sources said.
Rogan who runs the most popular podcast in the United States has a highly coveted and devoted
following that leans young male and numbers in the tens of millions.
The interview will offer Harris an opportunity to make her case to his followers as she works to
shore up support with male voters and Black men in particular. Numerous public polls suggest
Republican nominee Donald Trump could overperform among young men of all races.
On Monday the vice president released a new set of policy proposals to appeal to Black male
voters and her campaign is ramping up outreach to the typically Democratic voting group.
Her campaign also announced she will sit for an interview with Fox News whose day-to-day
programming is heavy on conservative punditry that often explicitly supports Trump.
On Monday Trump also indicated he plans to go on Joe Rogan?s podcast before Election Day on
Nov. 5.
Trump and Rogan who also serves as the UFC?s lead commentator have sparred in the past. Asrecently as August Trump took a shot at Rogan on social media platform Truth Social but later
called him a ?good guy.?
In 2022 Rogan said he is not a Trump supporter and in August said he preferred Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. for president. Kennedy has since dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed
Trump.
The appearance could offer a shot in the arm for Harris and Trump as polls show an incredibly tight
race between the two candidates that is expected to come down to the results in seven swing
states.
In March Spotify (SPOT.N) said that ?The Joe Rogan Experience? had 14.5 million followers
almost triple the platform?s second most popular program. He also has over 19 million followers on
Instagram and 17 million followers on YouTube.
A poll by YouGov last year found that 81% of his listeners are male and 56% are under 35 years
old feeding the perception that he has a direct line to a cohort that polling suggests tends to support
Trump over Harris.

exclusive poll finds
WASHINGTON ? Vice President Kamala Harris has a small lead over former President Donald
Trump in the key battleground state of Michigan according to an exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk
University poll.
With just six weeks until the election Harris leads Trump in Michigan by three points 48% to 45%
the statewide poll of 500 likely voters found. The results are within the poll?s 4.4% margin of error.
The poll was taken Sept. 16-19.
Michigan which has 15 electoral votes is regarded as an important swing state by the Harris and
Trump campaigns as they look for different pathways to accumulate the 270 electoral votes needed
to win. Four percent of Michigan voters remain undecided the poll showed.
Most people who have made up their minds are firmly in one camp or the other. Nearly 93% said
their mind is made up. Just 5% said they might change their minds.
Jeremy Parsons who is a registered Democrat but considers himself more independent leaning
said he is supporting Harris the Democratic candidate because he thinks she can relate better to
Americans and will be more willing to stand up to big corporations. He loathes Trump and is tired of
the country being run by wealthy white men.

?I?d vote for a cockroach-infested hemorrhoid over Donald Trump? said Parsons 46 an antiques
dealer from Holly Michigan.Trump might not be for everybody but he knows what?s best for the country said Olivia McKewen
27 of Mount Pleasant Michigan. An aspiring esthetician and a soon-to-be-married mother of a
2-year-old boy McKewen said Trump?s directness is needed in these hard times.
?Trump reminds me of my father who can be brutally honest even if it hurts your feelings.
Sometimes the truth can hurt? McKewen said. ?He?s not always there to make you feel better.
He?s not going to fill your ears up with some good soft words. He gets straight to the point: America
can be better.?
Extra candidates make race less predictable
Eight candidates will appear on the Michigan ballot including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who has
suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump the Republican candidate. Kennedy is supported by
roughly 1% of those polled while five other candidates get less than 1%.
Although those margins seem small they could make a profound difference in the national race
said David Paleologos director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center.
""If the Kamala Harris margin shrinks to a 1-point lead the entire state hinges on the fringes of the
Michigan ballot"" he said. The behavior of third-party voters ? people who are mocked for wasting
their votes ? could make the difference if they rotate to either Harris or Trump.""
Kennedy has been trying to get his name removed from some ballots especially in battleground
states such as Michigan (though he is trying to get his name on the ballot in New York despite not
being a candidate apparently in an attempt to weaken Harris' expected support there).The Michigan Court of Appeals ordered Kennedy's name removed from the state?s ballot but the
Michigan Supreme Court on which Democratic nominees hold a 4-3 edge reversed that ruling in a
split decision. Kennedy has appealed to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Harris leads Trump by three points (48%-45%) in the bellwether Kent County which includes Grand
Rapids and the surrounding area. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton 48% to 45% in Kent County in
2016 while Joe Biden beat Trump there 52% to 46% in 2020.
The poll shows a huge gender gap between the leading candidates with women backing Harris
over Trump 56% to 37%. Men prefer Trump over Harris 54% to 39%. Trump has a slight edge over
Harris among independent voters 42% to 41%.
A fierce debate and swing state voters:Readers in seven states weigh in on Harris-Trump debate
Greg Yoder 63 of Muskegon Michigan is an independent voter who?s supporting Trump. Yoder
who is unemployed said he prefers Trump?s foreign and immigration policies and believes he
would be a better commander-in-chief than Harris.
?She?s very standoffish and talks in circles? he said. ?I don?t believe anything she says.?
Philip Robbins a Democrat from Almont Michigan is backing Harris because he is concerned
about the economy.

helps to create. She doesn?t understand how he manages to keep the election a close race.
?I don?t like the hate he stirs up. The hate used to be hidden but he?s normalized it. He festers it?

Democratic nominee despite feeling that Biden was ?bullied? from running again. But Alonzo thinks
Harris wants to help Americans unlike Trump who she thinks is ?running to stay out of jail.?
?Kamala Harris gives me a sense of hope? Alonzo said. ?I want people to vote with their hearts
and their pocketbooks because if Trump wins we have these tariffs and nearly everything will be
even more expensive.?
Still on the fence
In a sign of how close the race remains Candy Meintze 64 of Stevenson Michigan said she?s
?officially undecided? even though she?s currently leaning toward Trump.
?I?m not staying home. I?m going to vote? said Meintze a married grandmother of seven andgreat-grandmother of three. ?My main issue with Trump is that he sometimes doesn?t know how to
keep his mouth shut. I agree with his stances on abortion the tax cuts and how he would handle
immigration but he just needs to stay on topic and be more focused.?
Kamala Harris' appeal to Republicans:Trump is weak on foreign policy
A part-time bookkeeper Meintze said she has her doubts about Harris especially on the economy.
She?s uncertain where Harris would find the funding to give up to $25000 in down payment support
for first-time homebuyers and capping child care costs at 7% of working families? income and tax
credits for young families.
?During the debate she was asked about a specific economic policy and I thought she avoided it
and talked about her middle-class childhood. I want more specifics? Meintze said. ?I don?t know if
she?s even presidential material.?

93,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Kamala Harris pushes tougher asylum restrictions during visit to
US-Mexico border
WASHINGTON ? Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris went on the offensive Friday
during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border saying she would impose tougher asylum restrictions if
elected president ? as former President Donald Trump hammers her on the Biden administration's
immigration policies.
Speaking from Douglas Arizona about 120 miles southeast of Tucson and home to the state?s
second busiest port of entry Harris said she will do more to reduce illegal border crossings. And
would take ""further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry.""
Although Harris did not discuss her plans in detail a campaign official said Harris would work to
make it harder to lift an emergency order put in place by President Joe Biden this year that
authorizes the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country without legal permission when the
border is overwhelmed.
""While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States our system
must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal."" Harris the vice president said.

Under executive action that Biden took in June the U.S. is compelled to turn away asylum seekers
anytime unlawful border crossings hit an average of 2500 people a day in a given week ? a
threshold that was regularly met during the height of the nation?s migration surge earlier this year.The existing policy requires the border to reopen when crossings dip below an average of 1500
people a day over one week ? a level still not reached even as border encounters have declined in
recent months. But Harris' change would require the number of average illegal border crossings to
drop further before a border reopening could occur.
""The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and
to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously"" Harris said.
Support for a 'pathway to citizenship'
Harris said migrants who cross the border illegally will be apprehended removed and barred them
from reentering the U.S. for five years. She also said her administration would pursue ""more severe
criminal charges against repeat violators"" while barring individuals who enter the U.S. illegally from
receiving asylum.
Despite taking a hardline stance on border security Harris said she also supports a ""pathway to
citizenship"" for undocumented migrants currently in the United States. She singled out farmer
workers and undocumented individuals who were brought to the U.S. as children ? known as
?Dreamers? based on legislation called the DREAM Act which never passed Congress.
?They are American in every way? Harris said. ""I reject the false choice that suggests we must
either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe orderly
and humane.""
And she sought to distance herself from the the child-separation policies of Trump accusing theRepublican nominee of making the challenges at the border of worse and still ""fanning the flames of
fear and division.""
""Let me be clear: That is not the work of a leader"" Harris said.
More:Donald Trump holds lead over Kamala Harris in Arizona exclusive poll finds
Trump who has promised ""mass deportations"" of undocumented immigrants in a second
presidency has repeatedly slammed Harris for her role as Biden's point person assigned to address
root causes of migration to the southern border.
""The worst border crisis in the history of the world"" Trump said Thursday in New York. ""And the
architect is Kamala Harris.""
Immigration ? historically a losing issue for Democrats in elections ? remains a liability for Harris. A
USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll this month found likely voters by a 50%-47% margin
believe Trump would do a better job handling immigration than Harris A Quinnipiac University poll
this week found Trump with a wider 53%-45% edge on immigration.
Ahead of her speech Harris made an unscheduled stop to view a stretch of a border wall
constructed under the Obama administration. She walked along the barrier for about 10 minutes and
was briefed by John Modlin chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol Tucson Sector and Blaine
Bennett the agent in charge for the Douglas Station Border Patrol.
Harris also met with Border Patrol officials to discuss disrupting the flow of fentanyl through the
border.""They?ve got a tough job and they need rightly support to do their job"" Harris told reporters.
Harris introduced by mother whose son died from fentanyl
Harris? trip came as she?s lagging behind Trump in Arizona a key battleground state. Trump is
leading Harris by 6 percentage points 48%-42% among likely Arizona voters according to a new
poll released Friday by USA TODAY/Suffolk University. The margin of error is 4.4%.
Theresa Guerrero whose son Jacob died from fentanyl in 2020 introduced Harris. Guerrero said
her late-husband was from Douglas and that she believes Harris will fight for families to curb
fentanyl from crossing the border.
?It was devastating when he died? Guerrero said of her son. ?It still is losing a child isn't something
you get over but I've made sure every single day since to make sure his death meant something
which is why I'm here.?
With signs that said ?border security and stability? flanking the stage Guerrero said she believes
that Harris is visiting the border because ?she cares about us she cares about our families and she
cares about securing the border.""
Continuing one of her central attacks on the campaign trail Harris emphasized Trump's role in
encouraging Republican senators to kill a bipartisan border bill this year that was packed with tough
new border restrictions and funding for more Border Patrol agents and immigration judges.
""It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union and it should be in effect today producing results inreal time right now for our country"" Harris said. ""But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the
phone and called some friends in Congress and said 'Stop the bill.' Because you see he prefers to
run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.""
Harris said the American people ""deserve a president who cares more about border security than
playing political games"" promising to bring the legislation back if elected.
The visit marked Harris' second trip to the southern border as vice president and her first as the
Democratic presidential nominee. Harris previously visited the southern border during a 2021 trip to
El Paso Texas. Trump campaigned at the U.S.-Mexico border last month in Sierra Vista Arizona.

'60 Minutes' interview
Vice President Kamala Harris revealed that she owns a Glock gun during the Democratic ticket's
interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" Monday night.
Harris told Bill Whitaker that she has fired the gun at a gun range and has had it for ""quite some
time.""
Harris told the nation that she was a gun owner during her debate against former President Donald
Trump who withdrew from the traditional interview with ""60 Minutes"" last week.
Harris initially acknowledged that she had a gun when she was a U.S. Senator and launched her
2019 bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Trump this summer was prepared for New York Police to revoke his state gun license following his
conviction on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records. CNN reported at the time thatTrump?s active concealed carry permit was suspended in April 2023 following his indictment on the
charges following the customary protocol in the state where gun licenses are frequently revoked

Capitol riot new book says
WASHINGTON ? Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell privately described then-President
Donald Trump as ""stupid as well as being ill-tempered"" ""despicable"" and a ""narcissist"" after the
2020 election according to excerpts from a forthcoming biography of the longtime Senate power
broker.
The remarks recorded by McConnell and shared with Associated Press Deputy Washington Bureau
Chief Michael Tackett are McConnell's strongest condemnation yet of the former president despite
years of a famously frosty relationship between the two men. The biography written by Tackett and
titled ""The Price of Power"" is set to be released on Oct. 29 just a week before Election Day.
In the weeks following Election Day in 2020 when Trump and his campaign were working to
overturn the election results McConnell said in his recordings that ?it?s not just the Democrats who
are counting the days? until Trump left office according to the AP. He also said that Trump?s
behavior ?only underscores the good judgment of the American people. They?ve had just enough of
the misrepresentations the outright lies almost on a daily basis and they fired him.?
McConnell said it's been ""really hard to take"" the results ""for a narcissist like him.""
""So his behavior since the election has been even worse by far than it was before because he has
no filter now at all"" he said.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
McConnell also alleged Trump's efforts to overturn the election would hurt Republicans in Georgiarunoff races for the Senate at the time which would determine control of the chamber. Now-Sens.
Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff both Democrats went on to win both races and take the
chamber.
Trump is ?stupid as well as being ill-tempered and can?t even figure out where his own best
interests lie"" he said.
McConnell also called him a ""despicable human being"" for ""sitting on this package of relief that the
American people desperately need"" referencing a coronavirus aid package that Trump wouldn't
approve. He did ultimately sign a stimulus package into law alongside a government spending bill at
the end of 2020.
After Jan. 6 2021 when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building as
lawmakers met inside to certify the election results McConnell said on the Senate floor that ""this
failed insurrection only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic.?
The AP reported that after McConnell made the remarks he went into his office and addressed
staffers who had been hiding. He started to cry as he thanked them calling the staffers ""family.""
McConnell and Trump repeatedly clashed throughout his presidency ? from efforts to repeal the
Affordable Care Act to Trump's racist comments about McConnell's wife then-Transportation
Secretary Elaine Chao.
Publicly McConnell largely stood by Trump during the years Trump was president and McConnell
was Senate Majority Leader. But after Jan. 6 when the chamber was considering whether to convict
the former president over the riot in an impeachment trial McConnell took to the Senate floor tocondemn Trump's role ? before voting along with other GOP senators to acquit him.
?There?s no question none that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for
provoking the events of the day? McConnell said at the time arguing the chamber has no power
over a former president.
Trump too has had nasty words for McConnell over the years. After McConnell's public remarks
following Jan. 6 Trump called him a ""dour sullen and unsmiling political hack.""
McConnell has now endorsed Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and said in a statement to the
AP that his comments about Trump ""pales in comparison"" with what now-close Trump allies Sen. JD

Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Monday October 7th 2024. This is The Excerpt.
Today the latest on a new storm brewing in the Gulf plus it's been one year since Hamas attacks
on Israel and we discuss concerns over postal delays in this year's election.
?
There's a new hurricane on the way Milton. The storm gained hurricane status yesterday as it rolled
through the Gulf of Mexico on a track headed Wednesday for parts of the Florida Peninsula stillreeling from Hurricane Helene. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will reach major
hurricane status later today meaning at least a category three. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
yesterday expanded a state of emergency that now covers 51 of the state's 67 counties. Rain which
has already begun in Florida could reach totals of five to 10 inches with localized totals up to 15
inches across parts of the Florida Peninsula and the Keys through Wednesday night. Hurricane
Center specialist Eric Blake said the rain brings the risk of widespread minor to moderate river
flooding. But there's still plenty of uncertainty over Milton's path and the storm could hit Florida as a
major hurricane or weaken according to the Hurricane Center. You can stay up on all the latest with
usatoday.com.

Today marks one year since Hamas attacked civilians in Israel and Israeli Defense Forces
responded with bombings and eventually a ground invasion in Gaza. The Gaza War has spread
across the Middle East and put Israel on the brink of war with Iran. The brutal invasion swept into
Israel and caught military defenses by surprise a year ago. Hamas gunmen attacked army bases
civilian communities and an all-night music festival about three miles from the Gaza border a year
ago today. Israel retaliated the next day. They've waged ensuing battles against Hamas and Gaza
then Hamas allies including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iranian forces in Iran. Hamas in its attacks
on Israel a year ago killed some 1200 people and took about 250 hostages according to Israeli
figures. Gaza's Health Ministry says Israel's Gaza Offensive has killed almost 42000 Palestinians.
For Shlomi Berger whose 20-year-old daughter Agam was taken hostage it has been a year of
agony. For Nour Swirki who has evacuated four different times and whose children are now living in
Cairo it has also been a year of agony. You can find a special edition episode of The Excerpt right

Election officials and lawmakers are worried that US Postal Service delays could prevent thousands
of ballots from being counted this year in what could be a close election next month. I spoke with
USA TODAY Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen to learn more.
Bart thanks for hopping on.
Bart Jansen:
Thanks for having me.
Taylor Wilson:
So Bart what are these concerns some state election officials have about postal delays during this
election? And do the numbers about post office delays really back up those concerns?
Bart Jansen:
It's a pretty serious concern put forward mostly by the National Association of Secretaries of State
those are the state-level officials that basically govern elections and also the National Association of
Directors of Elections.
Those folks have written a couple of letters to Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to say there are
these problems such as ballots arriving late that the first class ballots are supposed to arrive withinthree to five business days. And they say dozens hundreds in some locations arrived longer than
10 days after primary elections this year.
The concern is that if they show up late then they get discarded and folks are going to lose their
votes. So they've met with DeJoy a couple of times and they're trying to encourage him to just make
sure that the postal service does the best job that it can.
Now DeJoy has responded that the postal service understands the importance of ballots in both
directions getting mailed out from the government officials and then getting mailed back so that they
can be counted. They strive for punctuality. He said that 99%+ get delivered within seven days. So
they're not meeting their own first class goal but they are getting there within a week of business
days. He says they go to heroic efforts to try to get those ballots delivered.
But state election officials remain concerned. And with the election only about 30 days away they
want to make sure that everything is in place to do the best job that they can this time around.
Taylor Wilson:
Bart can you help us understand really just how popular mail-in voting has gotten in recent
elections especially since 2020? And are there any partisan leans in terms of who actually mails in
a ballot?
Bart Jansen:
Yeah the number of people using absentee ballots has grown dramatically largely in the 2020
election because of the coronavirus pandemic at that time where the share of people castingabsentee ballots was somewhere around 24% in 2016 but that it jumped up to 43% in 2020. So it
was just an enormous jump. Something like 60% of Democratic voters use absentee ballots but the
number is about half that of Republicans casting ballots that way.
So there's a bit of friction. There have been some Republican lawsuits that want to make sure that
ballots are cast correctly. They've alleged that the ballots maybe that aren't signed or dated that
they've got to be discarded.
There's actually a pending lawsuit that was just argued in the Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals
where the Republican National Committee is asking that no absentee ballots be counted if they
arrive after election day even though the state of Mississippi has a five-day grace period for ballots
to arrive after election day. Now their argument is the ballot was cast. As long as it's postmarked by
election day the person voted but it just isn't counted until perhaps five days afterward. But the
RNC says that they don't want any ballots arriving that late.
And so we're waiting on an appeals decision and that's a case where legal experts say that actually
go to the Supreme Court this year. So there's a lot of interest in absentee ballots and it's because
they're becoming so much more popular.
Taylor Wilson:
And Bart for folks listening thinking ""Hey I'm planning on mailing in a ballot here over the next few
weeks"" what advice do election officials give folks who do plan on voting by mail this year?
Bart Jansen:Yeah I think the message is the same from lawmakers who have voiced concerns about these
problems to the election officials who were administering the elections to the postal service itself
Mr. DeJoy all saying that the safest thing to do would be to mail a mailed-in ballot at least seven
days before the election.
One Secretary of State was telling me their advice has been if it gets to be Halloween you really
want to check that your ballot has gotten in because you might have to look for a different course of
action. People have really gotten used to the idea that you could... One person said ""Vote from your
couch. Vote from the kitchen table."" But you want to make sure that that ballot actually arrived and
so the way to do that is to send it in early.

President Joe Biden's administration continued to push back yesterday against former president
Donald Trump's unfounded claims about Hurricane Helene's storm recovery. Appearing on ABC's
This Week yesterday Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell saidher agency has all the resources it needs to respond to Helene which ravaged parts of Florida
Georgia North Carolina and other states. North Carolina and Georgia are key swing states in next
month's election which has heightened the political stakes for the recovery effort. Criswell defended
FEMA's response and shot down Trump's claims that the agency is short on disaster relief funds
because money has been diverted to help undocumented immigrants and that help is being
withheld from Republican areas calling such assertions frankly ridiculous and just plain false. Trump
has made a series of unfounded claims about Helene recovery at multiple events in recent days. He
said at a rally in Michigan Thursday that quote ""Kamala spent all her FEMA money billions of
dollars on housing for illegal immigrants"" unquote. You can read more with a link in today's show

A USA TODAY analysis shows most counties have become more partisan leaving less room for
compromise. I spoke with USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page for more.
Susan I thank you for hopping on today.
Susan Page:
It's my pleasure.
Taylor Wilson:
So Susan what did this exclusive USA TODAY analysis find really about how partisan leanings
have intensified in recent years?Susan Page:
You know we looked at trends by county more than 3000 counties in the United States and what's
happened from 2012 to 2016 to 2020. And what we found was in three-fourths of the counties the
red counties have gotten redder and the blue counties have gotten bluer. And if you want an
explanation of why our politics have gotten hotter there's one of them.
Taylor Wilson:
Yeah. So we also had some specific polling data here. What did this USA TODAY/Suffolk University
poll find really about how important it is to Americans that they live in a community Susan that
shares their general political views? And how did that compare to those who said it's important they
live in a community with diverse political views?
Susan Page:
You know it's pretty clear Americans feel pushed and pulled in two directions on this issue because
a majority of Americans 55% told us it's important to them to live in a community with people who
have political views much like their own. But even more Americans 60% said it was important to
them to live in a community with diverse points of view.
So we seem to be holding both these things as virtues at the same time. Some people feel both
ways think both things are important and of course some people think one or the other is more
important.There is a partisan divide on this. Republicans are much more likely to say ""Living in a community
with people of similar views is important to me."" Democrats are much more likely to say ""It's
important to me to live in a place with diverse views.""
Taylor Wilson:
And Susan as you write in the piece there's this kind of chicken-and-egg idea to this where some
Americans say redder policies or bluer policies in their states have actually pushed them to move
elsewhere. Can you talk through this idea?
Susan Page:
You know we see really a patchwork of laws across the country on things like abortion or
transgender care. And one reason we see that is because in most states in 40 of the 50 states one
party or the other controls all of the state government the governorship and the state legislature.
And that enables them to pass policies that seem either very conservative or very liberal even when
they're states next door to one another. You think of a state like Colorado next to a state like
Wyoming and they have very different attitudes on some of these big issues.
And why is that? It's because we've seen Colorado draw be a very attractive place for some
Democrats and we've seen Wyoming be a draw to some Republicans and conservatives. And so
that's sorting then is it's like a chicken-and-an egg aspect to the enactment of these policies. They're
the result of people sorting into states but they also lead to people sorting into states.
Taylor Wilson:So Susan really what are the implications of these redder red states and bluer blue states? What
does this functionally mean for next month's election and also just elections going forward?
Susan Page:
The sorting of states into being very red or very blue means that most states are irrelevant to the
election we're going to have in November. We know that there are only seven battleground states
that everybody's focused on. That's because we pretty much know where the other states are going
to go in this election.
Taylor Wilson:
And Susan in terms of the impact really beyond elections what can you tell us here? I know you
wrote about some of the other aspects of this.
Susan Page:
Social scientists have looked at the effect of living in communities mostly with people who are like
you by race or by religion. It reduces the opportunity to get to know people who are different. It
reduces the opportunity for conversations. It also reduces the need for compromise.
Taylor Wilson:
Susan Page is USA TODAY's Washington Bureau Chief with some great insight for us as always.

102,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Minnesota lawmakers urge Tim Walz to act after state employee
shared violent post about Donald Trump
More than 50 Minnesota state legislators sent Gov. Tim Walz a letter on Sept. 30 requesting he take
action against a state employee.
This comes after a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources employee posted ?Too bad they
weren?t a better shot? on their personal Facebook account following the July 13 assassination
attempt on former President Donald Trump.
On July 26 several legislators asked Walz to take action against the employee but the legislators
say Walz didn?t address the situation. With this new letter legislators are again asking Walz to take
action.
?Your refusal to act as Governor is troubling especially in light of the growing public demand for the
political violence to end? the letter reads. ?By not addressing this situation you are failing to act in
the interests of the people of Minnesota who seek peaceful political discourse without fear of
violence.?
The Minnesota DNR previously posted on social media condemning the incident calling the
employee?s statement ?reprehensible and inconsistent with (the DNR?s) views and values.? It also
said the Minnesota Data Practices Act limits the agency?s ability to comment further on the incident.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
A spokesperson from Walz's office directed the St. Cloud Times part of the USA TODAY Network
to the DNR. It in turn said the department is actively investigating the employee's post.Legislators are worried about the precedent this could create for public employees especially in light
of recent acts of political violence.
?Minnesotans expect taxpayer-funded employees to be held accountable to a standard of behavior
that is respectful and peaceful regardless of political views? Minnesota state Sen. Steve
Drazkowski a Republican wrote in a statement. ?Allowing state employees to publicly incite or
celebrate political violence is a dangerous precedent and degrades civic dialogue.?
""Political violence has no place in our state or nation and must not be tolerated"" Republican state
Rep. Bernie Perryman said. ""Minnesotans deserve to know they can freely participate in political
dialog without fear of violence but by his inaction the governor is failing to uphold that basic
cornerstone of our democratic republic.""
Potential legal factors
Since the DNR is a public entity rather than a private business University of Minnesota Professor of
Law Charlotte Garden J.D. tells the St. Cloud Times there are additional legal factors at play when
considering disciplinary measures.
""We're talking about the First Amendment because this is a public employer and obviously the First
Amendment does not apply to private employers"" Garden said. ""Private employers have fewer
constraints if they decide they want to fire somebody because of something they've said at work.""
Garden said this case is similar to the 1987 Rankin v. McPherson case when a county employee in
Texas said ""if they go for him again I hope they get him"" after the failed assassination attempt onthen-President Ronald Reagan. A co-worker overheard the comment and reported it leading to the
employee being fired.
The Supreme Court ruled that while direct threats to person's life would not be considered protected
speech comments on a matter of public interest spoken by an employee with no policymaking
functions and public interaction would be protected under the First Amendment.
Garden said the 1987 case posed two questions is the comment a matter of public opinion and did
the comment impact the functionality of the office.
In the similar comment made following the Reagan assassination attempt providing opinion or
comment on the assassination attempt was deemed a matter of public interest by the court.
However Garden said how the comment would impact the functionality of the department which is
the DNR in this Minnesota instance can vary from case to case.
""Sometimes a statement by an employee really does make it difficult for a public employer to
continue to function efficiently"" Garden said. ""An example the court would think about would be if
(the comment) diminished public trust in the agency.""
Despite these potential legal implications those signing the letter say there are still actions Walz can
take.
""There is no law prohibiting the Governor of Minnesota from calling for an employee's resignation
calling out an employee's behavior or performance or otherwise commenting on actions of state
employees"" the letter reads.Corey Schmidt covers politics and courts for the St. Cloud Times. He can be reached at

Taylor Wilson:
Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Saturday October 19th 2024. This is The Excerpt.
Today new evidence unsealed of how Donald Trump's January 6th 2021 rally was funded. Plus we
take a look back on a busy week in extremism news and why companies are hiring less.
?
New records released in the federal election interference case against former president Donald
Trump described how money was spent on Trump's Stop the Steal rally near the White House on
January 6th 2021. The revelations were among 1900 pages of evidence for federal charges
against Trump that he tried to steal the 2020 election. The evidence also includes details of how hissupporters spent election night at the White House and how Trump reacted to the riot at the
Capitol. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan is weighing the evidence to determine whether Trump is
immune to federal charges based on a Supreme Court ruling in July. Trump opposed the release as
an example of prosecutors publishing cherry-picked materials that would prejudice potential jurors
and endanger potential witnesses three weeks before the election. B`ut Judge Chutkan ruled that
keeping the documents confidential could also be considered election interference. The newly
released documents show that an unnamed organization budgeted as much as $3 million on the
January 6th rally and related events including for bringing VIP guests and protesters to Washington
and ad buys for a show of force. You can read more with the link in today's show notes.

It's been a busy week in the news when it comes to extremism in America. From a California State
House candidate's past spreading an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory to findings about US military
members increasingly turning to extremism. I caught up USA TODAY National Correspondent Will
Carless to discuss. Will how are you today? Thanks for hopping on the show.
Will Carless:
Doing good. Thanks for having me on.
Taylor Wilson:
So Will another busy week in the news of extremism. Let's start with Denise Aguilar. Who is she
what's she running for in California and really what's this controversial history?Will Carless:
I first found out about her a few months ago when I was contacted by members of the Sedition
Hunters that's the volunteer sleuths that are hunting down people who were at January 6th and who
went into the building. And they claimed that they had identified this lady who is now running for a
state assembly seat in Los Angeles. And she's the GOP front-runner. She's going up against her
democratic rival in November. She's not expected to win but she could win and she's a gosh how
do you describe Denise Aguilar? She's essentially a right wing extremist I think it's fair to say. She's
been a COVID denier she was involved in a militia and as our reporting found out a couple of
months ago she also went into the capitol on January 6th and then we just learned some new stuff
about her this week as well.
Taylor Wilson:
Yeah in terms of that new stuff what are we learning about her history spreading anti-Semitic
conspiracy theories?
Will Carless:
So the left-leaning think tank Media Matters for America found a video of Aguilar's from 2019
where she claimed that part of the power grid in California were turned off in 2019 not to prevent
fires that were raging at the time but actually to stop the Rothschild's a very famous prominent
Jewish family from trafficking children. It's obviously complete nonsense. It's utterly ridiculous. It's
the sort of thing that gets passed around far right extremist message boards. But it just shows the
milieu that this lady has been acting in over the last few years.Taylor Wilson:
And meanwhile Will we also heard this week that members of the US military are increasingly
turning to extremist ideologies after they've served the country. What did we really learn from this
Associated Press reporting and did this surprise you?
Will Carless:
Definitely didn't surprise me. I mean this is a story that we've been covering for the last two or three
years really since January 6th. As soon as it was clear how many people who were involved with
January 6th had military backgrounds and I believe the numbers about one in 10 we've done a lot
of reporting on this. I spent much of 2023 looking at the military's response to this. In the wake of
January 6th the new defense secretary Lloyd Austin put out a call basically calling for all sorts of
reforms. He started a working group to come up with all sorts of solutions and recommendations to
try and stamp out extremism. And as my reporting showed in 2023 almost all of that didn't happen.
And so a lot of these reforms that were promised never came about.
What the Associated Press story does is it looks in a new way at a set of data compiled by
researchers at the University of Maryland and shows that the rate at which people are becoming
involved in extremism is more amplified if people have a military background. And that really
reinforces past research that shows that there's a pretty strong correlation between people who get
involved in extremist groups and people who've had military backgrounds. I don't for the first
minute want to say that the millions of people who serve this country are overwhelmingly involved in
extremism. Of course they're not it's a fraction of the people who serve in the military but of the
people who get involved with extremism there is a strong correlation with having a military
background.Taylor Wilson:
All right. And separately Will this week comes on the heels of a disturbing story out of Florida from
last Sunday when a boat joined a floating Trump rally carrying I guess swastika flags. What
exactly happened here Will and how did others at the event respond?
Will Carless:
This is a group that is always doing things like this. Every few months they will pop up and they'll do
a rally or a march carrying swastika flags they'll shout anti-Semitic slogans they'll shout things like
""White power"" and ""See Kyle"" and things like that. They do it to get attention. I don't want to name
them people can read about it if they want to but this group showed up at a floating Trump rally a
boat rally with hundreds of boats where they flew both Trump flags and Nazi swastika flags. I think
it's important to note that they were immediately reviled and shouted at and even splashed by other
members of the Flotilla. Also an organizer of the event called them scum in a Facebook page. So
very clear that they weren't welcome but nevertheless they wanted to get their white supremacist
viewpoint across and they got a lot of headlines by doing so.
Taylor Wilson:
All right another busy week on your beat. You cover extremism and emerging issues for USA
TODAY. I appreciate the care that you bring to these stories and the info Will. Thanks so much.
Will Carless:See you again soon. Thank you.

Taylor Wilson:
Almost two months before Israel's military accidentally located Hamas's leader with the help of a
drone then killed him. Yahya Sinwar had been hiding in southern Gaza with six Israeli hostages
one of them an American citizen. The bodies of the hostages were recovered by Israel's military in
late August after they were executed by their captors in a near-miss rescue effort by the Israel
Defense forces. That incident set off a wave of protests and widespread criticisms of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu including from inside his own country. The revelation first reported this week
by Israel's Channel 12 broadcaster and confirmed to USA TODAY by a person familiar with the
matter yesterday comes amid intense speculation over who might succeed Sinwar as the leader of
Hamas and ultimately what impact his death will have on the pace and intensity of the war in Gaza
including whether it will accelerate efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal. Basem Naim a
senior member of Hamas's political wing said yesterday in a statement that Sinwar's death did not
mark the end of the organization and that the group cannot be eliminated. Hamas's Lebanon-based
ally Hezbollah vowed to escalate its fight with Israel after Sinwar's death. And Iran which backs
both groups with finance and weapons said Sinwar's death would strengthen regional resistance to
Israel.
?
With the economy cooling companies are hiring less and asking employees to do more. I rang up
USA TODAY Economics and Jobs Reporter Paul Davidson to discuss. Paul thanks for making thetime today.
Pau Davidson:
My pleasure.
Taylor Wilson:
So Paul it's clear that companies are hiring less. Really what do the numbers say here?
Pau Davidson:
The companies are hiring it looks like about 5.3 million workers which was August and that's
actually below pre-pandemic levels. If you think about the great resignation you think about the hot
economy following the pandemic people were hiring like crazy. Hiring I think was near record levels
way above pre-pandemic levels. And then the economy's cooled sales have cooled. Meanwhile
costs are still pretty high for businesses. Labor costs went up a lot last few years material costs
inflation was very strong so they basically had to pull back hiring both because demand has ebbed
some and their costs remain high. Hiring is it's not bad it's not historically at a very very low level
but it's below pre-pandemic levels which is noteworthy.
Taylor Wilson:
And Paul as you write lots of businesses grappling with some of these issues are really instead
training existing employees to handle new tasks instead of hitting the job market and bringing new
folks in. I'm curious what impact that's having on the workforce and what do we hear from workers?Pau Davidson:
They feel like they have workers there who are already doing the job and in some cases doing jobs
that were related to the jobs they're trying to fill. And so in a lot of cases they're just saying ""Hey
you used to operate the CNC computerized factory machine and you used to have another person
bringing you the tools and setting the tools for you in the machine. Why don't you now supply your
own tools to the machine because the guy or the gal who's supplying you those tools has now left?
And rather than us filling that role our profits are squeezed can you please do this job?"" And so
they're training them to do those sorts of things. That's just one example.
In most cases workers if you look at the employers I talk to they're pretty amenable to doing it. I
mean at least that's what I'm hearing. In other cases I've heard that there are issues in a
manufacturing environment where your workforce is unionized. In some cases unions are raising
some issues. At least in some cases employees are also not thrilled with the idea of ""Hey you're
going to give me a bunch of stuff to do but you're not at least right away raising my pay."" So I
know of at least one case in a manufacturing environment in Indiana where the employees really
didn't want to take on these new tasks so they got laid off.
I think in a professional services environment it's a little more informal maybe more collegial and I
think the employees are taking on these tasks. I think a lot of times they look at it as ""Hey I'm
beefing up my resume I'm learning a new skill and it can help me advance in my career."" They're
doing it even if they don't necessarily get a pay increase right away. They think that's going to come.
And meanwhile they're expanding their knowledge base and maybe helping them down the road.
Taylor Wilson:What's the expectation for what's next in terms of hiring and firing in America moving into the new
year?
Pau Davidson:
The job market is supposed to continue to cool for a while. You have inflation come down but still
prices are up there. Meanwhile consumers and workers they've had all this pandemic money. They
had stimulus checks they had money they saved up from not going out during the pandemic. All
that is sort of dissipated and inflation is still kind of high. So consumer spending is not bad it hasn't
tanked but it was really growing a lot and now it's growing a lot less strongly and for
low-to-middle-income consumers they have really high debt levels. If you're a higher income
person hey you're still spending pretty strongly but if you are low to middle income you got all this
debt delinquencies are at about a 12-year high mostly because of those low-to-middle income.
Now the Fed is cutting interest rates right? So that's a major factor there that should be helping
because high interest rates that means you drive up cost of car loans of credit card bills
mortgages. As those start to come down that should be helping. Monthly job growth has been
running I think around 200000 the last few months. It's down from where it was. It's going to
continue to fall maybe to around 100000 into next year. So it's going to be this kind of a situation for
a while before it starts to pick up hopefully maybe by the second half of next year as interest rates
really significantly come down. And that should give another jolt to the economy to things like home
buying and buying cars and things like that.

The Project 2025 political playbook doesn?t include plans to close the National Hurricane Center
though it does say its work should be reviewed. Project 2025 does recommend modifying and
downsizing the agency that the center falls under.
Playbook says center serves 'important public safety' role
The claim came a day before Hurricane Helene made landfall near Perry Florida as a Category 4
storm on Sept. 26. More than 30 Helene-related deaths had been reported as of Sept. 27 USATODAY reported.
The National Hurricane Center has issued numerous advisories and forecasts as the storm has
moved across the south.
But contrary to the claim in the post Project 2025 ""does not call for the elimination of"" the National
Hurricane Center Heritage Foundation spokesperson Ellen Keenan told USA TODAY. The text
backs up her description.
The playbook calls for a review of the center's work but it also notes the key public safety role the
agency serves. Here's the section in full:
Review the Work of the National Hurricane Center and the National Environmental Satellite Service.
The National Hurricane Center and National Environmental Satellite Service data centers provide
important public safety and business functions as well as academic functions and are used by
forecasting agencies and scientists internationally. Data continuity is an important issue in climate
science. Data collected by the department should be presented neutrally without adjustments
intended to support any one side in the climate debate.
The center is part of the National Weather Service which falls under the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. Project 2025 accuses NOAA of ""climate alarmism"" and calls for it to be
""broken up and downsized.?

musician Taylor Swift's endorsement of Harris. Behar says she thinks artists should publicly support
Harris calling former President Donald Trump an ?existential threat to the country.?
Usher responds with the following:
?You know what? I don't get too deep into politics. I didn't get a chance to watch the debate last
night. I obviously have been watching like everybody else. I think voting is an individual choice. I
think that you're right ... you look at the reality of the country that we are and the country that we
want to be and find the candidate that you feel ... who fits the category of where we want to be. And
that's it. And that's what you vote based off of. Who you highlight and how you choose to highlight it
on whatever platform you have is your perogative.

107,Liberal,USA TODAY,"No government shutdown for now: Congress agrees on temporary
funding deal through December
WASHINGTON ? Congress has reached a deal to extend government funding through Dec. 20
leaders announced on Sunday. They're expected to kick the can down the road as lawmakers try to
dodge a devastating shutdown.
The agreement avoids the shutdown that was slated to begin at midnight on Sept. 30 ensuring
Americans retain access to crucial government services and sidestepping an embarrassing political
blunder with just weeks until the presidential election.
?If both sides continue to work in good faith I am hopeful that we can wrap up work on the CR this
week well before the September 30 deadline. The key to finishing our work this week will be
bipartisan cooperation in both chambers"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. said in
a statement on Sunday.
The House is expected to vote on the funding extension known as a continuing resolution or CR on
Wednesday. The Senate will take it up shortly thereafter in time to avoid a shutdown. It is expected
to pass both chambers and be signed by President Joe Biden.
Still the country isn't out of the woods. Lawmakers will have to negotiate a longer-term deal after the
election ? setting up another political fight in the final weeks before Congress turns over and a new
president takes over the White House.
House Speaker Mike Johnson R-La. unveiled the plan in a letter to his House colleagues earlier on
Sunday. The speaker also noted the tricky political tightrope Congress must navigate ahead of the
election.""As history has taught and current polling affirms shutting the government down less than 40 days
from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice"" Johnson said in his letter.
The deal struck between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate came after
Johnson tried and failed to pass a six-month extension that included a bill requiring people to show
proof of citizenship to vote. The deal announced on Sunday didn't include the effort.
That bill was always doomed in the Senate as Democrats argued noncitizen voting is already illegal
and extremely rare and that the legislation could instead make voting harder for millions of
Americans who don't have easy access to their citizenship documents.
Former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to allow the government to shut down if they
were unable to pass the voting legislation which he claimed could impact the results of the
presidential election.
Schumer criticized the GOP effort again on Sunday saying ?While I am pleased bipartisan
negotiations quickly led to a government funding agreement free of cuts and poison pills this same
agreement could have been done two weeks ago. Instead Speaker Johnson chose to follow the
MAGA way and wasted precious time.""
While Sunday's deal excludes the contentious voting legislation it does propose $231 million in
additional funding for the U.S. Secret Service. The funding comes after a gunman attempted to
assassinate Trump in July grazing his ear and another man was discovered this month lying in wait
just outside the fence of a Florida golf course where Trump was playing.What happens in a government shutdown?
During a government shutdown federal employees who are classified as ""nonessential"" are sent
home and paid once the government reopens. ""Essential"" workers ? those necessary to keep the
most crucial elements of the federal government functioning ? would keep working and receive their
pay.
Social Security Medicare and Medicaid benefits are considered essential and would continue
though it might be harder to get through to representatives for assistance during a shutdown. Other
key benefit programs such as military veterans programs and food programs would also continue.
The U.S. military and federal law enforcement agencies including the FBI Drug Enforcement
Administration and prison staff as well as the Secret Service Coast Guard and border security
agents would also keep working.
National parks and monuments would close to the public and it may be harder to get other
government services like assistance with passports and visas during a closure. Child care
programs like Head Start would be left without funding.
Airport security and air traffic controllers would keep working but there could be airline delays due to
absenteeism.

108,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Opinion: An abortion ban killed her. Trump used Fox town hall to
mock her grieving family.
Correction & clarification: A prior version of this column misspelled the name of Fox News host
Harris Faulkner.
The death of Amber Thurman a 28-year-old mother has been linked directly to Georgia?s
draconian abortion ban a ban that exists because Donald Trump proudly oversaw the end of Roe.
v. Wade during his presidency.
At a Fox News town hall focused on women?s issues ? taped Tuesday in Atlanta and broadcast
Wednesday ? Trump the network host and the town hall attendees treated Thurman?s death and
her family?s grief like a laugh line.
Noting that Thurman?s family held a press call hosted by Democratic presidential candidate Kamala
Harris? campaign before the Fox News event host Harris Faulkner with snark in her voice said to
Trump: ?Amber Thurman?s family have come out on a press call and they?re doing what?s called
a prebuttal to our town hall right now.?
?Oh that?s nice? Trump said dismissively as the crowd chuckled.
Then he said: ?We?ll get better ratings I promise.? And Faulkner and the crowd erupted in laughter.
Trump delivers one of the most vile moments of his campaign
I?ve seen plenty of vile things happen during political campaigns but this was several steps beyond
twisted.Who weighs the words of a grieving family or the weight of their grief on a ratings scale? Who
laughs at a family speaking out about the death of their loved one?
It?s part and parcel of the darkness and cruelty Trump?s campaign has leaned into in these final
weeks of the presidential race.
Opinion:Trump concocts a racist dystopian version of America only he can save us from
Amber Thurman's tragic death was deemed 'preventable'
During Tuesday?s press call Thurman?s mother Shanette Williams said: ?Amber was not a
statistic. She was loved by a family.?
Thurman died in 2022. Georgia?s abortion ban had forced her to travel to North Carolina for
reproductive health services because she was just past Georgia?s six-week ban on abortions.
Thurman was given abortion pills but developed a rare complication after she had returned to
Georgia.
Opinion:Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights. Don't forget what her husband did.
According to a ProPublica report: ?She showed up at Piedmont Henry Hospital in need of a routine
procedure to clear (fetal tissue) from her uterus called a dilation and curettage or D&C. But just that
summer her state had made performing the procedure a felony with few exceptions. Any doctor
who violated the new Georgia law could be prosecuted and face up to a decade in prison. Thurmanwaited in pain in a hospital bed ... as doctors monitored her infection spreading her blood pressure
sinking and her organs beginning to fail. It took 20 hours for doctors to finally operate. By then it
was too late.?
ProPublica reported that Georgia?s maternal mortality review committee found Thurman?s death
was ?preventable? and said the hospital?s delay ? due to the state?s abortion law ? ""had a large
impact on her fatal outcome.?
Donald Trump easily laughs at a tragedy ? remember that
There?s nothing funny about any of that. It?s a tragedy. But Trump Faulkner and many in the
all-female crowd at the town hall got a good chuckle out of Trump?s dismissive attitude and his
?we?ll get better ratings? joke.
I hope voters are paying attention to these random acts of casual cruelty coming from Trump and
the people around him. They?re the kind of things that rob us of our humanity.
They?re the kind of things voters should reject thunderously.

109,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Opinion: Harris claims she's for the middle class. Where's she been
for the past 4 years?
If Democrats are the party of the working class they sure have a weird way of showing it.
On Wednesday while speaking at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh Vice President Kamala Harris
made a pitch to the middle class. Her speech comes as consumer confidence has plunged to the
lowest level since August 2021 thanks to a slowing job market and higher costs for food housing
and other essentials.
If this election comes down to any one issue it won't be abortion or immigration. It will be the
economy.
Yet Harris' economic proposals are more about pandering than solutions. Her plan for example to
hand out $25000 to first-time homebuyers is meant to attract younger voters. But how much would
that giveaway add to the already soaring budget deficit? How would it affect inflation? What would it
mean to the affordability of housing in the long term? Harris' guesses are as good as mine.
What Harris wants voters to forget
During her speech Harris criticized former President Donald Trump's personal wealth and portrayed
herself as an advocate for the middle class.
?For Donald Trump our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not
those who actually build them. Not those who wire them. Not those who mop the floors? Harris said.
The Democratic presidential nominee also pushed a plan to boost manufacturing while ripping onTrump's economic record: ""All told almost 200000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his
presidency starting before the pandemic hit making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on
manufacturing.""
Opinion:Harris lies about Trump and flip-flops on policy. What does she really stand for?
Harris of course wants voters to forget more recent history ? when inflation hit a 40-year high with
Joe Biden in the White House. She also wants to ignore polls that show voters trust Trump's
handling of the economy more than her own.
The vice president's speech pulls from her new 81-page policy book ""A New Way Forward for the
Middle Class."" In Pittsburgh she said her plan would lower costs and help America become a global
leader in ""industries of the future."" Harris promised ""commonsense solutions to help Americans buy
a home start a business and build wealth.""
But if her manufacturing plan is simple common sense then why hasn't the Biden-Harris
administration been following it for the past four years?
Harris' economic plans won't have 'positive impact'
I'm not the only one who thinks Harris' economic plans stink.
""We did not find a positive impact on the economy from her plan in any future year. The Trump plan
does increase GDP for a few years but lowers by the end of the 10-year budget window"" a
spokesperson for the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model told Newsweek.The U.S. economy is a mixed bag at the moment. Stocks have recently hit record highs and
unemployment remains low (but rising).
Yet tens of millions of Americans say they're struggling more often to pay bills now than in years
past. One big reason why so many are feeling so much economic pain is because grocery prices
have risen almost 26% since Election Day 2020.
Opinion:I love being a parent but it's overwhelming. Here's how I've learned to cope.
The vice president has had four years to address soaring food prices and skyrocketing rent costs.
She hasn't done it.
Harris' economic plans sound like fixing a flat to plug holes in an economy that desperately needs
major repairs and a full tank of gas.
Trump's economy wasn't perfect but it worked better for many Americans ? and voters know it.
Even those in the middle class.

110,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Opinion: Michigan and Wisconsin are key for Harris. GOP groups
want to help her win them.
The presidential election is 30 days away and voters are starting to hear plenty of forceful
sentiments from Republicans about Donald Trump.
It's not the kind of talk the former one-term Republican president wants out there about himself.
With the presidential race a dead heat and less than a month to go every vote along the margins
matters. Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump know that and they are running very different
campaigns. She's working feverishly to expand her reach while he stokes his base and hopes to
energize low-propensity voters.
A key advantage for Harris: She has Republican allies doing some heavy lifting for her.
Republicans are lining up to help Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump
Consider Republican Voters Against Trump which last week launched a series of ads and
billboards spending $15 million to feature former Trump voters explaining how his behavior has
persuaded them to cast a ballot this year for Harris.
Then there is Haley Voters for Harris courting center-right voters who previously backed former
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in this year's Republican primaries for president. That group last
week started a seven-figure digital ad buy that presents Harris as a better option than Trump for
voters concerned about the economy.
Opinion:Trump and Vance seem very upset with being fact-checked. Maybe lie less?Harris is embracing the GOP support appearing Thursday in Ripon Wisconsin ? the birthplace of
the Republican Party now in a critical swing state ? with former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney a Republican
who lost her Wyoming seat in 2022 due to her sustained criticism of Trump during and after his
presidency.
Cheney's father former Vice President Dick Cheney is also backing Harris over Trump.
Trump on the other hand has been on a binge of ego-boosting rallies where he rambles on for
more than an hour at a time about a litany of grievances in front of supporters who are already
planning to vote for him.
Harris is aiming for something new in crossover support. Trump is offering the same-old same old.
A look at the voting math in swing states
The math tells a tantalizing tale in the ""blue wall"" swing states of Michigan Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin.
Haley won more than 297000 votes in Michigan's Feb. 27 Republican primary eight days before
she dropped out of the race. In the last presidential election Joe Biden defeated Trump in that state
by 154188 votes.
Haley took nearly 77000 votes in Wisconsin's Republican primary in April a month after she had
dropped out of the race. Biden beat Trump there by 20682 votes four years ago.And Haley received nearly 159000 votes in Pennsylvania's April 23 Republican primary seven
weeks after she left the race. Biden defeated Trump in that state in 2020 by 80555 votes.
Republicans were backing Haley before and especially after her bid was over. Does it really matter
now that Haley endorsed Trump in July after questioning in January whether he is ""mentally fit"" to
be president again?
In an incredibly tight race Haley's supporters in those three states could swing this for Harris.
The Republican must know this because her former presidential campaign had a law firm send
Haley Voters for Harris a ""cease and desist"" letter on July 23 ? a week after she endorsed Trump at
the Republican National Convention ? demanding that the group not use her name.
Haley Voters for Harris responded by saying its rights to engage with her supporters ""will not be
suppressed.""
What's the goal of these groups? Keep Trump away.
Craig Snyder national director for Haley Voters for Harris told me the group's ad is aimed at
center-right voters ""pretty much anywhere they go on the internet"" ? including YouTube Facebook
streaming apps like HBO Max and gaming platforms.
It's geographically targeting 1.5 million voters in Pennsylvania 600000 in Michigan and 400000 in
Wisconsin.
Opinion:New Jan. 6 court filing shouldn't scare voters. Trump would never do that again!Snyder a longtime Republican said his group is making the ""affirmative case for Harris in terms of
her record and her policy proposals and why we think that those should not be scary to center-right
voters.""
Part of the pitch is that Republicans stand a good chance of winning back control of the U.S. Senate
in November and that the U.S. Supreme Court has a six-to-three conservative majority.
""Neither party is going to end up with complete control of our government"" Snyder said. ""There's too
many firewalls. There's too many checks and balances.""
Republican Voters Against Trump Snyder said is working toward the same goal but focused more
on defining the former president ""as a threat to democracy"" in part due to his behavior before
during and after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 2021.
Campaign finance reports filed by both groups ? Haley Voters for Harris raises money as PivotPAC
while Republican Voters Against Trump goes by Republican Accountability PAC ? show significant
support from establishment Democrats and political action committees and nonprofits that lean that
way even if the potential audiences for the ads don't.
Snyder didn't dispute that but said his group's small-dollar donations come from people identifying
as Republican from more than 40 states.
""So it's very much a bipartisan coalition of people who are working together."" he said
Meanwhile Trump is still very much TrumpHere's another thing both groups have working for them ? Trump just keeps acting like Trump. If his
behavior drives center-right voters to Harris all the better for the never-Trumpers.
Trump on Friday posted a long screed on his social media site Truth Social excoriating Cheney and
her father for backing Harris mocking her as ""a low IQ War Hawk"" and claiming that both are
""suffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""
He also threw a social media tantrum Wednesday after a prosecutor's brief was unsealed in his
federal criminal case tied to the Jan. 6 insurrection that shed new and shocking light on his
behavior. His freak-out was the standard stuff ? calling the filing an ""ILLEGAL ACTION"" in a ""Witch
Hunt"" to harm him and his reelection campaign.
Trump's fixation on grievance isn't doing much to expand his base. But building on a base requires
discipline and focus not exactly attributes that come to mind when thinking about Trump these
days.
It looks like the best thing that could happen for Republican Voters Against Trump and Haley Voters
for Harris ? and for Harris herself ? is for Trump to just keep on being Trump for the next 30 days.

111,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Opinion: Trump said so many stupid things this week I decided to
just round them up
We?re less than three weeks to the 2024 presidential election and Donald Trump is growing more
unhinged by the minute. In this week alone he?s said enough outrageous things that would hurt any
other candidate in the polls. Somehow he escapes unscathed.
In two interviews this week ? one with Bloomberg the other with Univision ? the Republican
presidential nominee referred to COVID-19 as the ?China virus? claimed we are headed toward
World War III mispronounced Vice President Kamala Harris? name and downplayed the events of
Jan. 6 2021.
Despite his repeated gaffes and increasing incoherency the former president is polling just below
the Democratic nominee in terms of support. ABC News' 538 is projecting Harris beating Trump in
the polls 48.4% to 46.3%.
Early voting is underway in multiple states. As undecided voters mull their decision I implore them
to ask themselves if this is what they want back in the White House.
Trump dances after supporters faint during town hall
Trump started off the week at a town hall in Pennsylvania moderated by South Dakota Gov. Kristi
Noem. Early on in the night two supporters needed medical personnel. His response?
Trump told his crew to play the music ""nice and loud"".
Then for 39 minutes Trump swayed while his favorite songs played. The playlist included ?NothingCompares 2 U? by Sinead O?Connor ?Y.M.C.A.? by Village People and ?It?s a Man?s Man?s
Man?s World? by James Brown. He walked off the stage to ?November Rain? by Guns N? Roses.
?Memory? from the musical ?Cats? rounded out the night.
At 78 Trump would be the oldest president in our nation?s history ? something that becomes more
apparent every day. He doesn?t seem to think it?s an issue.
Opinion:Harris' 'Call Her Daddy' podcast interview was a smart way to excite her base
The next day when talking about his Supreme Court nominees with Bloomberg at the Economic
Club of Chicago Trump made a comment about the age of his appointees.
?You tend to put them in young? Trump said. ?Only stupid people put old.""
Trump jokes about family of Georgia woman who died because of abortion ban
Right before a Fox News town hall in Georgia he joked about the family of Amber Thurman a
28-year-old woman who died after doctors delayed necessary care due to the state's six-week
abortion ban. To Trump that's an acceptable punchline.
""Amber Thurman?s family have come out on a press call and they?re doing what?s called a
prebuttal to our town hall right now"" Fox News host Harris Faulkner told Trump before the event
began.
""Oh that?s nice"" he said. ?We?ll get better ratings I promise.?Opinion:Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights. Don't forget what her husband did.
It shouldn't have to be said but death should never be a joke.
It's especially vile when you remember that the overturning of Roe v. Wade happened because of
Trump ? something he has bragged about on the campaign trail.
Trump said he's the 'father of IVF'
He has repeatedly tried to obscure his record on abortion rights. At the same Fox News town hall
that extended to in vitro fertilization a practice that has come into question in the post-Roe era.
?I?m the father of IVF so I want to hear this question? Trump said when asked about the
procedure. No no one is really sure what he means by that.
Trump previously expressed support for in vitro fertilization in the wake of the Alabama Supreme
Court decision that threatened it. The Republican Party could do something about it but no: A bill to
protect access to the procedure is stalled in Congress.
Opinion:Trump ally Laura Loomer launches disgusting homophobic attack on Pete Buttigieg
Trump continues spewing lies and hate about immigrants
During his interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait Trump doubled down on his
claim that a Venezuelan gang has taken over an apartment complex in Aurora Colorado despite
the mayor calling this story ?grossly exaggerated.?Then on Wednesday he would not take back his false claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield
Ohio eating pets when asked about it during a town hall for Latino voters hosted by Univision.
?I was just saying what was reported that's been reported ? and eating other things too that they're
not supposed to be? Trump said.
These stories are harmful to the communities they purport to be about. It is shameful that Trump and
his running mate Sen. JD Vance of Ohio refuse to apologize for spreading these falsehoods.
No matter where Trump goes he says something awful. We as a country deserve better than an
overgrown spoiled oligarch who can't stop spouting hate.

112,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Polls for Texas' US Senate race show virtual tie between Colin Allred
and Ted Cruz
Some polls show this year's Texas Senate race is virtually tied energizing Democrats in a state
where no candidates in their party have won a statewide election since 1994. A new poll released
on Monday shows Democratic challenger Colin Allred within striking distance of Republican
incumbent Senator Ted Cruz.
The poll released by the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation shows Cruz leading Allred by three
percentage points 48% to 45% nearly within the margin of error of 2.83% for this poll.
Among Hispanic voters in the state Allred has a commanding lead 50% to 39% an 11-point gap
between the Democrat and the Republican candidates.
?We have continued to see Allred consistently outperform the top of the ticket in this race. The data
suggests that this speaks more to Allred?s favorables than what we are seeing in the National
conversation? said Jason Villalba CEO of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation.
Both candidates trade leads among other groups
Allred?s lead extends beyond Hispanic voters in Texas the polling shows: Allred led Cruz by double
digits among African-American voters and women as well.

Cruz leads by 21 percentage points among likely white voters and by 20 points with men across the
state.A close race in the Lone Star State
Monday?s poll is not the only one showing a close race in Texas. Last week a poll released by
Morning Consult showed Allred leading the race by one point. Another one by Emerson College and
the Hill showed Cruz leading Allred by four points just outside the margin of error of 3.3%.
The tightening of what has been a Republican seat for more than three decades has prompted
concerns among some Republicans including Donald Trump?s co-campaign manager Chris
LaCivita who shared his concerns in a post on X.
What to know about Colin Allred
Allred is a relatively new face in Texas politics winning for the first time in 2018 when he unseated
incumbent House of Representatives member Republican Pete Sessions who had served in the
same seat for 22 years.
Allred?s seat the Texas 32nd congressional district encompasses parts of the Dallas metro area
and other adjacent suburbs. It had been considered a solidly Republican seat until Allred?s victory
almost six years ago.
Before his foray into politics Allred played for four years in the NFL as a linebacker for the
Tennessee Titans. After his career in football he obtained his law degree and subsequently worked
as a civil rights attorney.
What to know about Ted CruzAllred's competition is incumbent Senator Ted Cruz who has been serving as the senator from
Texas for the last 11 years. He succeeded Kay Bailey Hutchison who unseated Bob Krueger the
last Democrat to serve Texas in the Senate.
Cruz served as the solicitor general of Texas before being elected to the United States Senate in
2012. Apart from his duties in the Senate Cruz also unsuccessfully ran for president in the 2016
Republican primary.

Former President Donald Trump is leading by six points in Arizona while Vice President Kamala
Harris leads by four points in Pennsylvania according to new polls from the New York Times
Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College.
The poll of more than 1600 voters across two crucial swing states illustrates the deadlocked nature
of the presidential contest as both candidates race to convince a tiny sliver of undecided voters to
choose them.
Trump's strength in Arizona has been buoyed by voters' concerns about the economy while Harris
has maintained an edge in Pennsylvania largely due to her stance on abortion. Voters in the
Keystone State said they trusted her over Trump to handle the issue of abortion by 20 percentage
points.
Harris' lead in Pennsylvania is within the margin of error but mirrors a consistent small lead in
polling for months. The state is seen as the most important battleground state in this election with 19
electoral votes.
Trump has an 11-point lead over Harris in Pennsylvania on the economy which grew from a 4-point

The claim: Project 2025 'wants to end FEMA'
A Sept. 30 Threads post (direct link archive link) claims a federal agency that responds to disasters
may be eliminated if former President Donald Trump is reelected.
?Somebody should tell Republicans in Florida Georgia South Carolina North Carolina Tennessee
and Virginia that trump?s (sic) project 2025 wants to end FEMA? reads the post.
It was reposted more than 700 times in two weeks. Another version of the claim spread on Threads.
Fact check roundup: Hurricane paths FEMA response spur dangerous misinformation
More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook
page
Our rating: False
Project 2025 doesn?t include a plan to close the Federal Emergency Management Agency but it
does call for reform. It recommends dismantling the department FEMA falls under and incorporating
its existing agencies into other federal departments. The plan says FEMA is needed to respond to
widespread disasters.
Playbook says FEMA needed in 'truly catastrophic disasters'
The claim came days after Hurricane Helene hit the southeastern U.S. killing more than 200 peopleand causing destruction that could cost upward of $30 billion. FEMA has been involved with
search-and-rescue efforts and has provided aid including meals and water to communities affected
by the storm.
But the claim about Trump and his supposed plan for FEMA is baseless.
First Project 2025 isn?t a plan from Trump as USA TODAY previously reported. It?s a 900-page
political playbook crafted by the Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative groups.
It is filled with policy recommendations for the next Republican president.
The playbook has an entire chapter devoted to proposals for the Department of Homeland Security
which oversees FEMA. The opening paragraph says its primary recommendation is to dismantle the
department ""along its mission lines"" and move some of its existing agencies to other federal
departments or in the case of the Transportation Security Administration privatize them.
The plan suggests FEMA be housed under the Department of the Interior or combined with the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Department of Transportation.""
The chapter's subsection on FEMA does call for significant reform of the agency but it also
recognizes the role it plays in responding to disasters.
It begins by saying the agency is ""overtasked"" and ""overcompensates for the lack of state and local
preparedness and response and is regularly in deep debt.? It goes on to condemn what it deems as

At no point however does the plan call for eliminating FEMA.

Trump has however criticized the federal response to hurricanes Helene and Milton and spread
false claims that FEMA is short on disaster relief funding because it has diverted money to migrants
in the U.S. illegally.
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell countered by saying the agency is fully equipped to meet theneeds of hurricane survivors and called Trump?s rhetoric ?frankly ridiculous and just plain false?

117,Liberal,USA TODAY,"SpaceX accuses California board of bias against Musk in decisions
over rocket launches
Elon Musk?s SpaceX is suing a California commission and accusing members of political bias after
the commission rejected the company's request to allow for more rocket launches from a California
air base.
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California against the
California Coastal Commission which is tasked with planning and regulating the usage of land and
water on the California coast.
Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara California has been host to SpaceX Falcon 9
launches since 2013 and the company requested to increase launches to up to 50 a year from the
current 36 allowed by the state.
In a recent meeting the commission voted 6 to 4 to deny the request from SpaceX to increase the
amount of launches. During the vote commissioners quoted environmental concerns as part of their
refusal to approve the request from SpaceX.
Following the meeting Musk?s company filed a lawsuit that asked the court to prohibit the
commission from regulating the company's rocket launches according to court documents.
SpaceX says it has been ?punished? for free speech
One of the arguments leveled by SpaceX?s attorneys claims that the decision from the commission
is in retaliation for some comments from Musk - the company's leader and largest stakeholder.?But the Commission?s unconstitutional overreach does not stop at punishing SpaceX for
constitutionally protected speech beliefs and practices that has no relevance to the proposed
launches? effects on coastal resources?the actual issue pending before the Commission? the
lawsuit said.
SpaceX's lawyers also accused Commissioner Caryl Hart of bias with the lawsuit quoting
comments the commissioner made in a recent meeting.
?The concern is with SpaceX increasing its launches not with the other companies increasing their
launches . . . we?re dealing with a company . . . the head of which has aggressively injected himself
into the Presidential race and made it clear what his point of view is? the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit also quoted other members of the commission namely Commissioner Gretchen
Newsom Commissioner Mike Wilson and Commissioner Dr. Justin Cummings calling their claims
""irrelevant biased concerns about Mr. Musk's politics.""
SpaceX?s lawyers argued that these comments were politically biased against the company and the
decision to deny their request for increased launches.
Musk has been increasingly involved with the right
In recent months Musk has become a vocal supporter of conservative candidates and causes
voicing his support for former President Donald Trump?s campaign and even donating at least $75
million to the America PAC which Musk helped found.
He also made an appearance at a recent Trump rally in Butler Pennsylvania the site of one of theassassination attempts against Trump.
""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who
could not climb a flight of stairs and another who is fist pumping after getting shot"" Musk said during
his speech chanting ""Fight fight fight.""

119,Liberal,USA TODAY,"This AI chatbot can help you get paid family leave in 9 states. Here's
how.
A generative artificial intelligence tool that guides parents through the process of applying for paid
family leave is expanding its digital footprint to all states that offer the benefit.
Paidleave.ai ? a free AI chatbot through national nonprofit organization Moms First ? will now be
available to working moms in nine states and Washington D.C. CEO and founder Reshma Saujani
told USA TODAY.
Saujani shared the news exclusively with USA TODAY. She plans to make the announcement
Tuesday at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in New York.
In an interview Saujani said she hoped the national rollout will lead more parents to take advantage
of the benefits. She also hopes it fuels momentum for a national mandate.
?The more people who have stories like ?I was able to take time off to care for my ailing father ?I
was able to take time off to be with my baby when she was in the NICU the more we have those
stories the easier it?s going to be for us to be able to pass federal paid leave? she said.
The news comes amid growing bipartisan support for a national paid family leave policy.
Though paid leave has broad bipartisan support among voters the U.S. is just one of a handful of
countries ? and the only wealthy industrialized economy ? without a federal paid leave policy.
Paid family leave typically covers a portion of a worker?s paycheck for eight to 12 weeks.The U.S. offered paid leave and subsidized child care during the COVID-19 pandemic but much of
that spending lapsed.
Only about 27% of Americans working in the private sector have access to paid family leave through
their employer according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Those workers who can least afford to take unpaid time off work are also the least likely to have
access to paid leave.
Just 6% of workers in the lowest 10% wage category ? predominantly women and workers of color ?
get that benefit compared to nearly half of workers in the top 10%.
Paid family leave has become a hot topic during the presidential election cycle though there is wide
disagreement over how to pay for it.
Eight in 10 voters want politicians to prioritize caregiving policies like paid leave a Morning Consult
poll from Melinda French Gates? company Pivotal Ventures and Bipartisan Policy Center found in
June. One in 4 voters ? and 1 in 3 younger voters ? regularly care for family members the poll
found.
As vice president Kamala Harris advocated for President Joe Biden?s unsuccessful bid for 12
weeks of paid leave for all workers. Her running mate Tim Walz established paid leave as governor
of Minnesota.
When he was president Donald Trump pushed a parental leave policy at the urging of his daughter
Ivanka Trump and enacted paid leave for federal workers.Recent polling from the University of Maryland?s Program for Public Consultation found that
bipartisan majorities of Americans in six swing states ? Arizona Georgia Michigan Nevada
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ? as well as nationally support creating a national 12-week paid family
and medical leave program for all workers.
A measure in Pennsylvania that would provide up to 20 weeks of paid family leave through a payroll
tax has bipartisan sponsorship but faces GOP opposition. Some 55% of Pennsylvania Republicans
support a paid family leave mandate according to the University of Maryland poll.
With a bipartisan push in the Senate and House to extend paid benefits to more workers stalled a
growing number of states ? California Colorado Connecticut Massachusetts New Jersey New
York Oregon Rhode Island and Washington ? and the District of Columbia have stepped into the
breach.
Four more states will begin offering benefits in 2026: Delaware Minnesota Maine and Maryland.
Even when paid family leave programs are available and workers are eligible participation is low
Saujani said.
Fewer than 5% of eligible workers claim paid family leave benefits because they are unaware of the
benefits and the application process is convoluted and complicated she said.
Saujani conceived of Moms First?s free AI chatbot to tackle that problem. Paidleave.ai began as a
pilot program in New York in December 2023.The chatbot which is trained on verified resources about paid family leave programs walks parents
through the process from understanding and accessing benefits to navigating the application.
?For many parents who go on to one of these state websites and apply for paid leave it?s just
confusing. By using generative AI it simplifies the benefits process for parents and answers their
questions"" Saujani said. ""It tells you three things really clearly. Am I eligible for benefits? How much
money am I going to get and how much time I can take off? And what?s my action plan??
In New York the highest increase in usage of paid family leave was among women of color. So
Moms First is launching a digital campaign called ?Paid Leave Pays? to reach low- and
moderate-income parents in states with paid leave programs.
?The pilot in New York really showed us something we already knew which is that moms really care
about this issue and we need to have innovative solutions to make sure they get the benefits that
they deserve and that they have earned? Saujani said.",USA TODAY_This_AI_chatbot_can_help_you_get_paid_family_leave.pdf.pdf,news_articles

Tuscaloosa between No. 2 Georgia and No. 4 Alabama.

As far as political strategy is concerned it?s easy to argue that Walz going to Minnesota vs.
Michigan in Ann Arbor is a smarter play than Trump going to Georgia vs. Alabama in Tuscaloosa.Alabama is one of the reddest states in the country one that hasn?t voted Democrat for president
since Georgia native Jimmy Carter was at the top of the ticket in 1976. Trump won Alabama by 62
percent in both 2020 and 2016.
Meanwhile Michigan is pretty purple. Trump narrowly won the state in 2016 before losing it by about
three percentage points in 2020 to Joe Biden. Before Democrat Gretchen Whitmer took the
governor?s mansion in 2019 Republican Rick Snyder was a two-term governor in Michigan.
Which is all to say it?s widely assumed that Alabama will vote for Trump again while Michigan is
very much in-play as a toss-up. With less than 40 days until the election the New York Times
reported Saturday morning that Trump and Harris are ?neck-and-neck? in Michigan.
And it?s not entirely surprising that Walz didn?t make a pick in the Michigan versus Minnesota
game. He is after all a man with other allegiances in the Big Ten.",USA TODAY_Tim_Walz_went_to_Minnesota-Michigan_at_the_Big_Hou.pdf.pdf,news_articles
121,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Trump-led attempt to pick up Nebraska electoral point halted by state
lawmaker
After former President Donald Trump reignited a conservative push to snag one of Nebraska?s
electoral votes that could decide the presidential election a key state senator whose support is
needed to make it happen quashed Republican hopes Monday.
State Senator Mike McDonnell said in a statement that he would not support altering Nebraska's
current system which splits its electoral votes by congressional district. Democrat Kamala Harris
Trump's opponent in the Nov. 5 election is slightly favored to win one electoral vote from
Nebraska's 2nd congressional district which includes Omaha.
A bill to change the system would require 33 votes out of 49 seats in the legislature. Republicans
control exactly 33 seats which means they cannot afford even a single defection with Democrats
united in opposition.
""I will not change my long-held position and will oppose any attempted changes to our electoral
college system before the 2024 election"" McDonnell said in a statement noting that the election is
only 43 days away.
In his statement McDonnell urged Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and other state lawmakers to pass a
constitutional amendment during the next legislative session and put it on the ballot for Nebraskans
to decide.

Despite the Cornhusker State being traditionally red its 2nd district which surrounds Omaha hasvoted for Democrats twice since it began splitting its votes in 1991. This includes former President
Barack Obama in 2008 and President Joe Biden in 2020.
Often referred to as the ""blue dot"" by Democrats Omaha could be crucial in the presidential
election.
If Vice President Harris won the Rust Belt states of Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania while
Trump captured the Sun Belt states of Arizona Nevada Georgia and North Carolina the Nebraska
vote would determine whether Harris won 270-268 or whether the race ended up a 269-269 tie.
And if the Electoral College is tied the House of Representatives selects the winner with each state
delegation getting a single vote - a scenario that would likely favor Trump.
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham a South Carolina Republican and a staunch Trump ally met with
Nebraska lawmakers last week to discuss the proposal.
""To my friends in Nebraska that one electoral vote could be the difference between Harris
becoming president or not"" Graham said in an interview on ?Meet the Press? on Sunday.

Famous Arena'
Madison Square Garden known as ?The World?s Most Famous Arena? in New York City will be
the venue for a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump during the final stretch of his
reelection campaign.
A campaign official told NBC New York on Wednesday that the ""arena tour"" will take place on Oct.
27 nine days before Election Day on Nov. 5.
The event is expected to be first come first served and campaign officials expect sizable numbers
given that MSG has a capacity for more than 19500 people.
Known for live sports and entertainment MSG is home to the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's
New York Rangers but the venue is also no stranger to politics and controversy ranging from
Democratic and Republication conventions to landmark visits from dignitaries including two popes
and even a Nazi rally in 1939.
The history of Madison Square Garden
Since its inception Madison Square Garden has had four transformations within New York City.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
The first MSG (1879-1890) was an open-air arena built on the corner of East 26th Street and
Madison Avenue in Manhattan and could seat 10000 spectators.The second MSG which was in the same location but an enclosed venue cost more than half a
million dollars to build and opened on June 6 1890.
The third version built in 1925 was located on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets in
Manhattan on the site of the city's trolley-car barns and remained in use until 1968.
The fourth and current MSG was built in 1968 atop the original New York Penn Station in midtown
Manhattan between Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets Station.
Major political rallies at the Garden
1924 Democratic National Convention which took 16 days and 103 ballots to nominate a
presidential candidate was held at MSG III.
1939 pro-Nazi rally: The German American Bund held a rally with over 20000 attendees. The rally
was billed as a pro-""Americanism"" event but anti-Nazi protesters gathered outside MSG III.
Democratic National Conventions in 1976 1980 and 1992 were held at current MSG.
2004 Republican National Convention: The first time the Republican party held their convention in
New York City.
Controversy
New York State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal D-Manhattan denounced the former president's
planned rally on social media on Wednesday: ?Let?s be clear. Allowing Trump to hold an event atMSG is equivalent to the infamous Nazis rally at Madison Square Garden on February 20 1939.?
He encouraged MSG to cancel the event.
The Trump campaign swiftly condemned Hoylman-Sigal's comments according to the New York
Post saying ?This is the same type of dangerous rhetoric that led to two assassination attempts on
President Trump?s life and has divided our country? said the campaign's national press secretary
Karoline Leavitt.

124,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Trump?s virtues health care issues: Five takeaways Kamala Harris?
Univision town hall
LAS VEGAS ? With just weeks until the general election Vice President Kamala Harris made her
case to Latino voters ? a key demographic that Democrats are slightly losing ground with.
Harris fielded about a dozen questions from Latino voters from across the country during Thursday's
""Noticias Univision Presents: Latinos Ask Kamala Harris Responds? town hall. Topics ranged from
how she will improve the health care system the Biden administration?s response to the recent
hurricanes to whether it?s fair that she?s now the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden
stepped down.
And she was even asked to put politics aside and name three virtues about her opponent
Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. (Spoiler: She couldn?t.)
Around 100 Latinos some who were flown from key battleground states like Wisconsin and Arizona
sat in a semicircle in stadium-style seating for the town hall. The attendees often asked questions
that combined top issues facing the country: health care housing immigration and the economy.
The town hall comes as Harris is trying to appeal to Latino voters including in key battleground
states like Nevada and Arizona.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
Although Harris holds the support of a majority of voters in those states ? 57% in Arizona and 56%
in Nevada according to the USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls published this week ? the vice
president is still slightly trailing the support Biden got in the 2020 election in those states.The polls found 38% of Latinos in Arizona and 40% of Latinos in Nevada plan to vote or lean
towards Trump.
Nationally 54% of registered Latino voters support Harris while 40% support Trump according to a
NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll released in late September. Six percent said they were unsure or
wouldn?t vote.
The administration?s Hurricane response and disinformation
As another hurricane barreled into Florida ? less than two weeks after Helene hit the Sunshine
State Georgia Tennessee North and South Carolina ? Harris was asked about the Biden
administration?s response to the catastrophic storms. She was also asked about whether FEMA
assistance and other resources are being distributed accurately.
Harris said there has been a lot of disinformation on what the administration has been doing to help
communities who have been ravaged by the storms saying ?this is not a time for people to put
politics.? She criticized the notion that resources and support are only going to certain people based
on political agenda.
She noted the administration is working with local and state governments in states like Georgia
North Carolina and Florida with both Republicans and Democrats in the states to ensure
communities get the resources that are needed to recover from the storms.
?They are entitled to relief? Harris told town hall attendee Ramiro Gonzalez who is from Miami.How Harris will address an array of health care issues
An issue at the top of mind of many of the attendees of the town hall: health care.
One attendee Ivett Castillo of Las Vegas told Harris just like the vice president she lost her
mother. Holding back tears Castillo explained she died six weeks ago. While she lived in the United
States for decades she was not a U.S. citizen ? and therefore did not have good health care.
Francisco Medina of San Diego Calif. asked Harris how she would improve the health care system
after he was forced to go to Mexico to receive care. And another woman Martha Rodriguez talked
about her experience with long COVID after a heart attack and homelessness as a result.
Harris touted the Biden administration?s efforts to lower insulin costs for seniors and how there?s
still more to lower costs for people (especially as Latinos have high rates of diabetes Harris said.)
Harris also criticized Trump saying that he supports extreme proposals that would lead to more
people being denied health care because of pre-existing conditions.
In regards to Rodriguez Harris also said she?s working to help wipe away medical debt.
As she was walking out following the town hall?s conclusion Harris stopped by Castillo. The two
held hands as Harris spoke with her before exiting the stage.
How could Harris be the Democratic nominee one attendee asked
One undecided voter Mario Sigbaum of Santa Monica Calif. made it clear he was upset. He was
upset that Biden was pushed out by the Democratic Party. And he didn?t understand how Harrisbecame the name at the top of the ticket.
Harris was quick to thank Sigbaum for being so ?candid? with his question and praised Biden for
his ""decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous that a president
could make.""
She said she earned the nomination and has the backing of a diverse coalition both by Democrats
and Republicans.
But what she underscored was that this election is unprecedented so her candidacy was
unprecedented.
?We are literally having a choice as the American people about choosing a path either that is about
rule of law democracy or something that is about admiring dictators? Harris said.
The two top issues: Economy and immigration
Harris was also hit with questions about two issues that have been among the most important to
Latinos and Americans generally: the economy and immigration.
Harris was asked about the high cost of living and what she would do to help the middle class
especially for adults who have to take care of their children and their parents. Harris who called that
the ?sandwich? generation touted her recent Medicare plan to provide home care for seniors.
She also outlined her proposals to address price gouging from corporations expanding the child tax
credit and her $25000 first-time homebuyers down payment assistance proposal.Harris also walked the line on how she would address immigration ? both at the border and
immigrants who have been living in the United States long term.
Harris said she would pass a defeated bipartisan border security bill that would increase border
agents. She also advocated for comprehension immigration reform and finding a pathway to
citizenship for undocumented individuals who were brought to the U.S. as children ? known as
?Dreamers? based on legislation called the DREAM Act which never passed Congress.
Harris was asked to name 3 virtues Trump has. She couldn?t.
In her final question at the town hall Harris was asked to put politics aside.
Harris who has often touted her support from a wide array of voters including Republicans (she
even did so at the town hall) was asked to name three virtues that Trump has. First Harris began
by saying that Trump has tried to divide the country by taking an ?us vs. them? approach to
Americans and that he uses language and name calling that belittles people.
?I don't think that's healthy for our issues and I don?t admire him? Harris said.
But she tried to offer one compliment of the former president: ?I think Donald Trump loves his family
and I think that's very important. Family is one of the most important things that you can prioritize.?
But Harris conceded she does not know Trump well. She has only met him one time at the debate
they had last month.","USA TODAY_Trump’s_virtues,_health_care_issues_Five_takeaways.pdf.pdf",news_articles
125,Liberal,USA TODAY,"US intel says Russia behind fake 'hit and run' video attacking Kamala
Harris
WASHINGTON ? Russia is escalating its election meddling efforts with a focus on denigrating Vice
President Kamala Harris to help elect Donald Trump U.S. intelligence officials said Monday.
The Kremlin is creating new videos and also altering existing clips in some cases using artificial
intelligence to undermine the Democratic nominee and alienate her potential supporters as Harris is
locked in a tight race with Trump just 43 days from election day the intelligence officials said.
Exhibit A in a background briefing the officials gave on Monday: A widely distributed report from a
bogus news site falsely claiming Harris left a 13-year-old girl paralyzed in a hit-and-run.
Intelligence officials monitoring overseas ?malign influence? efforts have concluded Russia is using
a variety of information operations to attack Harris and boost Trump one official with the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence or ODNI said.
More:Senate warns of unprecedented foreign interference in 2024 election
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
The officials also released an ""Election Security Update"" report to the public summarizing its most
recent findings.
Many of Russia's newest efforts focus on altering videos and then boosting them across all social
media platforms on divisive issues like immigration that it believes will cost Harris votes and help
return Trump to the White House the officials said. U.S. intelligence concluded long ago thatRussian President Vladimir Putin was behind similar efforts in 2016 and 2020.
The intelligence officials would not comment on specific efforts targeting Harris other than the false
hit-and-run video.
The Trump and Harris campaigns did not respond to requests for comment.
More:Russia wants Trump back in White House. Iran doesn't. Let the election hacking begin.
But the ODNI official said some of the videos being altered and shared by Russian cyberwarriors are
being done specifically to paint Harris in a bad light both personally and in comparison with Trump.
That official like several others who briefed reporters spoke on the condition of anonymity to share
the latest intelligence on what foreign adversaries like Russia Iran and China are doing to interfere
in the presidential race ? and in some cases down ballot races across the country as well.
The other noteworthy development the officials said is that foreign adversaries notably Russia are
using artificial intelligence in their disinformation efforts ? but more as an accelerant of their existing
efforts rather than anything that is revolutionizing campaigns that have been underway for years.
China for the most part has stayed out of trying to influence the presidential race one way or the
other the officials said and Iran has continued to sway voters against Trump in keeping with
previous intelligence that the officials cited in earlier briefings.
An actor in a wheelchairThe fake video about Harris which shows a young girl in a wheelchair claiming to be a victim of a hit
and run surfaced in early September on a bogus website masquerading as a local San Francisco
news outlet.
Last week the security team at Microsoft issued a report saying Russia was behind the fake ad. The
ODNI official said Monday that the U.S. assessment was independent of Microsoft?s.
In its Sept. 17 report Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center said the fake story was created by a
Kremlin-aligned group dubbed Storm-1516 as part of a ?synchronized shift? by three Russian
influence operation that are now targeting Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
A video embedded in the article featured a female paid actor discussing the non-existent
hit-and-run Microsoft said. The website was created on Aug. 20 and went offline after being
debunked.
'Outlandish' stories millions of views
The U.S. intelligence officials said they cannot gauge the reach or effectiveness of the videos.
But Microsoft suggested that they have been viewed widely.

The first video it said depicts an attack by alleged Harris supporters on what the video?s amplifiers
claim is a Trump rally attendee. Microsoft said that video received millions of views and sought to
?inflame political divides by stirring racial and political tensions.?
The second video Microsoft said was the hit-and-run video produced by Storm-1516 which then
?laundered? the video through a website for a fake TV station it had created just days beforehand.
At the beginning of September the other Russian influence actor cited by Microsoft Storm-1679
also pivoted its influence operations to focus on Harris after primarily focusing its campaigns on
creating divisive content around France and the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Our rating: False
The video shows a religious group marching in Springfield. There is no evidence it is connected to a
Haitian militia.
Religious group posted videos photos of march
The Haitian community near Springfield has received unwelcome attention in recent weeks after
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance claimed falsely
that immigrants there were eating people?s pets. In the ensuing weeks the community has seen
threats of violence.The march in the video however is not of a Haitian militia forming in Springfield. It shows members
of Israel United in Christ a religious group whose members from nearby Columbus Ohio said on
Facebook they ""BLITZED Springfield Ohio On A Mission To Wake Up The So Called Haitians Who
Are The Tribe Of Levi.""
Israel United in Christ says on its website that it believes people of color are ?the true and historical
descendants of the Biblical Israelites? and wants to unite various communities. But it has been
designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and it is described as an
?extremist sect within the Black Hebrew Israelite movement? by the Anti-Defamation League
because of anti-Semitism and racism seen at its events.
The group?s identity is clear in the first moment of the video as it starts with people calling out
?IUIC? an acronym for the group.
IUIC Columbus based about 45 miles east of Springfield posted photos of the march to its
Facebook group. IUIC Haiti posted a video of the march along with news coverage of the false
claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The video of the march in the Instagram post shows the
corner of John Street and Lincoln Park in Springfield as confirmed by Google Maps.

127,Liberal,USA TODAY,"Walz on claims he was in China during Tiananmen: 'I'm a
knucklehead at times'
WASHINGTON ? Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he ""misspoke"" on longstanding claims that he was
in Hong Kong in the spring of 1989 when the Tiananmen Square massacre left hundreds dead.
Recently discovered news reports from Nebraska showed the Democratic vice presidential nominee
was actually in the United States during that time and left for China that summer after the
massacre.
Asked to explain that discrepancy during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday night
Walz struggled to succinctly answer.
""I have tried to do the best I can"" he said. ""I have not been perfect and I'm a knucklehead at times.""
He said he learned a lot from his time in China and that it was evidenced in his career in public
service.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
""Many times I will talk a lot I will get caught up in the rhetoric"" he said. ""Being there the impact it
made the difference it made in my life I learned a lot about China.""
""I got there that summer and misspoke"" he concluded.
Walz cited the anecdote during a 2014 Congressional hearing saying he was in Hong Kong in May
1989. ""And as the events were unfolding several of us went in. And I still remember the train stationin Hong Kong"" he said at the time. He repeated the claim on a podcast as recently as February.
But local news reports resurfaced by conservative news outlet the Washington Free Beacon indicate
he was still in Nebraska at that time.
The Alliance (Neb.) Times-Herald featured a photo of Walz touring a Nebraska National Guard
storeroom on May 16 1989. The photo's caption says Walz ""will take over the job"" of staffing the
storeroom from a retiring guardsman and ""will be moving to Alliance"" Nebraska CNN reported.
Another newspaper article published by a Nebraska-based outlet in April 1989 reported that Walz
planned on traveling to China in early August a month after the protests ended. Minnesota Public
Radio News and APM Reports first reported the possible contradiction.
Fact Check:What Tim Walz JD Vance got right (and wrong) in the VP debate
Walz may have also been misleading about how often he has traveled to China. During a 2016
interview the governor said he has visited the country ""about 30 times."" Additionally he told the
Congressional-Executive Commission on China in 2016 that he went to Hong Kong ""dozens and
dozens and dozens of times.""
Republicans have been critical of Walz's connection to China. House Oversight Chairman James
Comer subpoenaed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday for documents
related to the governor possibly having ties to the Chinese Communist Party.
""Throughout his career Governor Walz has stood up to the (Chinese Communist Party) fought for
human rights and democracy and always put American jobs and manufacturing first"" the Harriscampaign said in a statement to Minnesota Public Radio.
?Republicans are twisting basic facts and desperately lying to distract from the Trump-Vance
agenda: praising dictators and sending American jobs to China.""

Vem Miller the Nevada man arrested at a checkpoint in southern California allegedly en route to a
Donald Trump campaign rally was associated with a far-right movement called the Sovereign
Citizens according to the local sheriff.
Miller was arrested after police officers questioned him at a checkpoint and noticed his vehicle
sported an irregular license plate. The license plate was ?one that is homemade and indicative of a
group of individuals that claim to be sovereign citizens? Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told
reporters Sunday.
The Secret Service and other federal agencies said Trump was never in danger. Miller was released
on $5000 bail.
But what is the Sovereign Citizen movement? And why might law enforcement be concerned about
someone associated with the group?
More:Trump wasn't in danger from armed man at California rally officials say
Who are the Sovereign Citizens?
The Sovereign Citizen movement is a disparate collection of thousands if not tens of thousands of
anti-government radicals who believe they're not subject to local or national laws or authority. Many
sovereign citizens for example believe they don't have to pay taxes and there have been several
high-profile examples of members of the movement arguing their case ? unsuccessfully ? in the
courts.As opposed to an organized group or organization such as the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys
Sovereign Citizens are very much a ?movement? said Mark Pitcavage a senior research fellow at
the Anti Defamation League?s Center on Extremism.

More:Suspect arrested on weapons charges near Trump rally released
?They?re very anti-authoritarian? Pitcavage said. ?They don?t like anyone telling them to do
anything they don?t want to do. They don?t like any sort of authority.?
The U.S. Attorney?s Office said Sunday that ?the U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did
not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger.?
But members of the Sovereign Citizen movement have been involved in acts of anti-government
violence. In 2010 a father and son team of self-proclaimed Sovereign Citizens shot and killed two
police officers during a traffic stop in Arkansas before they were gunned down.
Sovereign Citizen movement grew under Trump
While not associated with any particular party due to their eschewing of politics the Sovereign
Citizen movement has nevertheless expanded and attracted new members during the Trump era.
According to a recent report by the ADL?s Center on Extremism the Sovereign Citizen movement
has grown in recent years ?by appealing to new audiences including anti-vaxxers QAnonadherents and MAGA supporters.?
?The movement has also spread extensively in jails and prisons around the country. Sovereign
citizens have increased their international presence as well spreading to a number of countries
around the world? the ADL briefing said.
The movement which started growing in popularity in the late 1970s is inspired and promoted by
Sovereign Citizen ?gurus? and leaders around the country many of whom espouse legal and
philosophical theories connected to the general anti-government ethos Pitcavage said.

presidential election
If you?re antsy about the potential results of the upcoming 2024 United States presidential election
between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump you might want to pay close attention to the matchup
between Caleb Williams? ascending Chicago Bears and Jayden Daniels? bright Washington
Commanders in Landover Maryland in Week 8.
An old tried-and-true rule (coincidence really) named after the Commanders? old racist nickname
dictates that Washington?s outcome in its last home game before the election dictates which
politician will win.
The precedent maintains that if the Commanders win this last home game the incumbent political
party will keep the presidency. If the visiting team wins the challenging political party will take office.
It has held true in 17 of the 19 U.S. presidential elections. The only exceptions have been very
recent with incumbent Barack Obama defeating Mitt Romney in 2012 after the Commanders lost
and Hillary Clinton (of the incumbent Democratic Party) losing to Trump in 2016 after the
Commanders won.
Otherwise if the Commanders win their last home game before that first Tuesday in November you
can safely bet on whichever party?s already in power maintaining the Oval Office. Of course some
believe the rule may have died when the Commanders changed their name but the general
precedent still remains.
Put another way: if you want Kamala Harris to win the 2024 election you?re probably rooting for the
Commanders to beat the Bears in a few weeks. If you want Donald Trump to win the 2024 election

132,Liberal,USA TODAY,"'I am a capitalist': Harris promises 'pragmatic' economic approach
WASHINGTON ? After pledging if elected president to crack down on companies that prey on
consumers Kamala Harris set out to prove on Wednesday that she's a capitalist whose policies
would be a boon for businesses that play by the rules.
Harris told business leaders in Pittsburgh that she believes most companies do seek to do right by
their workers and customers. The Democratic nominee who has spent her entire career in
government and wants to increase taxes on corporations said she would actively pursue
relationships between her administration and the business community.
""I've always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions"" Harris said to
applause. ""I also believe we need to engage those who create most of the jobs in America. Look I
am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the
road to create a stable business environment.""
Harris' first major economic proposal of the 2024 race was a pledge to sic government attorneys on
companies suspected of charging too much for food and groceries and direct them to scrutinize
potential mergers between top food companies.
She has also proposed lowering housing costs by barring Wall Street investors from buying homes
in bulk a practice that Democrats say is soaking up inventory and driving up costs for American
families. Harris says she will put a $35 a month cap on insulin and limit out-of-pocket costs for
prescription drugs to $2000 a year.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed that Harris is a ""Marxist"" ? she says
she's a capitalist ? and given her the nickname ""Comrade Kamala"" over her campaign plans which
include a proposed federal ban on price gouging in the food and grocery industries as a way to ease
inflation. It is one of the few proposals that Harris has put forward that is not a continuation or
expansion of Biden administration priorities.
Harris has also proposed tax incentives to get builders to construct properties that are meant for
first-time homebuyers and said she'll expand a deduction for entrepreneurs from $5000 to as much
as $50000 to fuel small business creation.
The Democratic nominee says she will pay for her proposals by increasing the corporate tax rate to
28% from the 21% a rate cut that Republicans in Congress pushed through when Trump was in
office. Trump has said that if he is reelected he'll lower the rate to 15% for companies that make
their products in the U.S.
""With the vision I?m outlining today not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign
lands but under my leadership we?re going to take other country?s jobs"" Trump said in a Tuesday
speech on the economy in Georgia.
Harris lays out economic 'philosophy' in Pittsburgh
In her Wednesday speech Harris said she would encourage partnerships between government and
private businesses as way to expand the middle class.
Harris leaned into her middle-class upbringing to underscore that she would take a practical
approach to economic policy that balances the needs of business and families that are trying to stayafloat.
""As president I will be grounded in my fundamental values. of fairness dignity and opportunity. And I
promise you I will be pragmatic in my approach"" Harris said at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh.
Borrowing a phrase from former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt Harris said she would pursue
""bold persistent experimentation"" that is not ""constrained by ideology"" and seeks ""practical
solutions"" to problems that applies metrics and facts and stays focused on crises and long-term
goals for the country.
Among the proposals that Harris touted: a $6000 child tax credit for families with newborns and
$25000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.
""I don't want you to have to worry about making your monthly rent if your car beaks down I want you
to be able to save up for your child's education to take a nice vacation from time to time. I want you
to be able to buy Christmas presents for your loved ones without feeling anxious when you're
looking at your bank statement"" Harris said. ""I want you to be able to build some wealth.""
Harris said she would cut taxes for middle-class Americans and provide every American access to
paid leave that can be used for caregiving of children and elder parents.
She invoked her late mother a cancer researcher at a federally-funded laboratory who she said she
had to take care of when she was diagnosed with the illness and contrasted her vision for a ""strong
middle class"" to Trump?s agenda.
""He has no intention to grow our middle class. He's only interested in making life better for himselfand people like himself ?the wealthiest of Americans. You can see it spelled out in his economic
agenda"" Harris said in Pittsburgh.
Heartburn over Harris Trump economic policies
Harris and Trump have been light on details of how their plans would bring down costs.
Trump has said he will go around Congress to impose across-the-board tariffs of up to 20% or more
on foreign imports. Harris and some economists have equated the Republican's proposal to a sales
tax that could hurt consumers and U.S. companies alike.
To enact most of her proposals Harris would to work with the legislative branch. For example a
price gouging ban and the tax deductions for businesses and consumers that she's proposing would
require congressional approval.
Economic agendas in focus
Harris' choice to make her economic case to the business community in Pittsburgh is a sign of how
her campaign is viewing the race six weeks out from the election. It's a major industrial city that she
has visited repeatedly in the roughly two months since she became the Democratic nominee
including during her preparations for her one and only debate against Trump.
Trump had an almost six-point edge over Harris when it came to the economy in a USA
TODAY/Suffolk University poll released earlier this month. The national survey gave Harris a
four-point lead in the race overall. A separate survey of Pennsylvania found Harris narrowly ahead
of Trump in Pennsylvania. The result was in the margin of error.Her campaign this week touted a letter from more than 400 economists endorsing her over Trump.
The letter said Trump's policies could fuel inflation hurt GDP growth and increase unemployment.

Steelers game
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pushed back against attacks on his age during a
campaign event in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Sunday that came between a visit
handing out fries at a McDonald's and plans to attend a Pittsburgh Steelers game.
""I'm not 80 and I'm not that close to 80"" the 78-year-old former president said at a town hall event
in Lancaster Pennsylvania.
""I've done cognitive tests. I've done them twice and I aced both of them and the doctor in one case
said 'I've never seen anybody ace them'"" Trump added.
Trump appeared to be referring to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment that his White House
physician Ronny Jackson now a Texas Republican congressman said the then-president
answered perfectly in January of 2018. Trump has previously claimed to have aced that test which
takes about 10 minutes and poses 30 questions including on naming the animal in an image and
repeating back a series of words.
During Sunday's town hall Trump also swung hard at Democratic presidential nominee Kamala
Harris' evolving position on fracking an energy-extraction technique used for natural gas in
Pennsylvania and more than two dozen other states. Harris called for banning the practice when
she first ran for president in 2019 although she now says she would allow it.

Earlier in the day the former president visited a McDonald's in Feasterville Pennsylvania where hedonned an apron worked the fry station and handed out food to pre-screened people at the
drive-thru.
For her part Harris on Sunday marked her 60th birthday with a visit to two churches in Georgia as
she encouraged early voting in another important swing state.
'She may have a cognitive problem'
Democrats in recent days have gone on offense over Trump's age and behavior including a town
hall in Pennsylvania last week where the Republican presidential nominee moved around to music
for nearly 40 minutes after ending his event's Q&A portion because of two medical emergencies in
the crowd.
At a fundraiser in Boston Tim Walz the Democratic vice presidential nominee and two-term
Minnesota governor referenced Trump's comments from a Saturday rally in Latrobe Pennsylvania
where the former president shared a story about a former professional golfer's private anatomy
praising the late-Arnold Palmer as ""all man.""
""These are folks that are out there and I run into them ? hell they're in my family -- and I run into
them they ? 'I don't really like Trump.' You mean you don't like him talking about Arnold Palmer in
the showers that stuff you don't like?"" Walz said on Sunday. ""And they get pretty embarrassed.""
Trump at his Sunday town hall pushed back on the criticism over his age by highlighting Wall Street
Journal opinion writer James Taranto who wrote in a recent article that there was no sign of
""slippage"" in Trump when the Republican nominee met with the paper's editorial board on Thursday.
While Trump's ""discursive style of talking can confuse listeners"" that was also true nine years agoaccording to Taranto.
At his town hall Trump tried to turn the tables back on Harris. ""She may have a cognitive problem
but but there's no cognitive problem"" he said.
'Frack baby frack'
Asked by a small businessman at the Lancaster town hall about gas prices Trump promised that his
future administration would cut electric and energy bills in half ""within one year"" by pushing policies
that expanded oil and gas production.
""What are we going to do? Drill baby drill. Frack baby frack"" Trump said.
Trump's campaign then played for the town hall attendees a series of video clips of Harris
discussing energy policy in her 2020 presidential campaign including one in which she said she was
""committed to passing a Green New Deal and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.""
""She doesn't want fracking. She's never wanted fracking"" Trump said.
Trump also claimed Harris along with California Governor Gavin Newsom ""destroyed"" California
but repeatedly mispronounced Newsom's last name to sound like New-""scum.""
""We're not going to let her destroy America"" he said.
Trump calls for shielding law enforcement from 'the bad things'A Pennsylvania county sheriff who said he had endorsed Trump asked the former president how his
plan for law and order would support local sheriffs. Trump replied that law enforcement officers
needed to be shielded from any legal repercussions.
""We have to protect our law enforcement. We have to indemnify them against the bad things""
Trump said.
Trump said that a law enforcement officer who does their job often gets attacked by critics who want
to take their job or pension or get the person fired.
""We have people that have to be given back authority and their respect because our cities are
blowing up"" he said.
Trump heads to Steelers game as Harris touts endorsements
Trump said he's planning to attend the Steelers-New York Jets game on Sunday night at Acrisure
Stadium in Pittsburgh.
In a press release ahead of the game the Harris campaign touted endorsements from former
Steelers players Jerome ?The Bus? Bettis and Joe Greene as well as from the family of former
player Franco Harris who died in 2022.
""It?s time for us to elect a leader who?s gonna fight for us. Someone who?s gonna roll up their
sleeves and get the job done. Not just complain about it at a half-empty venue"" Bettis said in a
video. ""There?s only one person in this race who fits that bill: Vice President Kamala Harris.""The Steelers are owned by Arthur Rooney II. His father the late Dan Rooney served as U.S.
ambassador to Ireland during the Obama administration. The Jets are co-owned by Robert Wood
Johnson IV a former U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom during the Trump administration.

Trump?s return to Butler Pennsylvania exactly three months after being shot there punctuates a
remarkable stretch in the nation?s political life one that saw the Democrats swap their

The Butler shooting hasn't appeared to significantly change the trajectory of the race. President Joe
Biden dropped out shortly afterward and Vice President Kamala Harris has been running much
stronger since she took his spot.
Yet it has become central to Trump?s campaign and claims that he is a persecuted figure. BeforeSaturday Trump had appeared in public at least 51 times since the shooting and referenced it in 31
of those appearances according to a USA TODAY analysis.
Trump and his allies have been tying the assassination attempt to other travails including his legal
cases and impeachments.
?Those who want to stop us? have slandered me impeached me indicted me tried to throw me off
the ballot and who knows maybe even tried to kill me? Trump said Saturday.
Trump in Butler didn?t mention by name the actual shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks. The FBI still
hasn?t found a motive for Crooks. That didn?t stop Trump?s allies from claiming again without
evidence that Democratic rhetoric contributed to the shooting.
Trump initially struck a much more compassionate and empathetic tone Saturday than at his
typically combative rallies spending considerable time honoring the victims of July 13. Rallygoer
Corey Comperatore was killed that day and two other attendees were injured. Trump praised ?our
beautiful Corey"" and met with his family before the event.
He also lauded the U.S. Secret Service and Butler public safety personnel - but eventually veered
into full-throated negative politics.

Noting that Election Day is now only a month away Trump attacked migrants and pledged mass
deportations hammered the Biden administration's hurricane response lauded running mate JDVance's debate performance protested the many investigations of his conduct bragged about what
he said are good poll numbers and criticized what he called a ""very corrupt political establishment.""
?I will never quit I will never bend I will never break I will never yield - not even in the face of death
itself"" Trump said.
At one point Trump said ""we have an enemy within"" but did not specifically identify it. He also told
supporters that ""we have an evil world - we have a very sick world.""
Trump did not mention Harris or Biden in the early part of his speech but eventually got around to
familiar rally-style riffs against ""Kamala"" and other Democrats.
He also told supporters that ""twelve weeks ago we all took a bullet for America"" and that a victory
by him in the election would be ""the greatest achievement in the history of politics.""
The rally also featured a special guest: Billionaire businessman Elon Musk who attacked Biden over
his age and said Trump's reaction to the shooting showed ""courage under fire."" Musk also predicted
dire consequences if Trump supporters don't register and vote.
?If they don't this will be the last election"" Musk said. ""That?s my prediction.""
Trump's speech capped a full-day program that was part memorial and part political rally featuring
Republican candidates musicians parachutists and a flyover by Trump's airplane.
""What an amazing crowd"" Trump running mate JD Vance said during his time on stage at the rally.
""We're here to say we can't be intimidated - we cannot be stopped. We won't be denied.""While paying tribute to Trump and the shooting victims Vance also attacked Harris and other Trump
opponents for using ""dangerous inflammatory rhetoric"" that has created an atmosphere for
violence.
""It was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him"" Vance said.
Vance attacked Harris for describing the Republican candidate as a threat to democracy and
added: ""Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy - what the hell have you done?""
Vance did not mention Trump's own use of violent rhetoric throughout his political career.
The Trump campaign also sought to turn the Butler event into a fundraising opportunity.
During the day the campaign sent out fundraising solicitations with an all-caps quote from Trump
saying: ""I'M BACK IN BUTLER TO ADDRESS THE NATION! If every PATRIOT chips in $5 we'll set
a RALLY RECORD:""
While Vance hit the Democrats for incendiary rhetoric some of the Republican speakers in Butler
supplied intemperate rhetoric of their own about the tense and close election.
""This is no longer a fight between Republican versus Democrat - left versus right - it is good versus
evil"" said Lara Trump the ex-president's daughter-in-law and a co-chair of the Republican National
Committee. ""And good is going to win this battle.""

135,Liberal,USA TODAY,"'I will own up when I misspeak': Walz talks misstatements abortion
debate in Fox News interview
Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz defended his record as the governor of Minnesota
and discussed everything from Middle East policy to his past misstatements and gaffes during a rare
national television appearance Sunday.
Making his first appearance on a Sunday morning political talk show since becoming a VP
candidate Walz joined ""Fox News Sunday"" after largely avoiding major interviews with national
media in recent weeks.
The governor repeatedly turned questions about his record into criticisms of former President
Donald Trump slamming him on everything from his stance on abortion access to his economic
stewardship.
Still Walz also was repeatedly asked about his own leadership in his home state. He was pressed
on a Minnesota abortion law he signed and what extent it allows the procedure late in a pregnancy.
He said the Minnesota law ?puts the decision with a woman and her health care providers.?
Some Republican lawmakers and candidates across the country have alleged that Democrats
widely want people who are pregnant to be able to obtain an abortion at any time even if they are
weeks from potentially giving birth.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
Abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy are already rare and they typically occur because of
serious fetal abnormalities. In 2019 about 93% of abortions occurred at or before 13 weeks ofgestation. About 1% of abortions occurred at 21 weeks or later according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
The governor accused Trump of supporting a national abortion ban though the former president has
explicitly said he wouldn?t block abortion nationwide. Asked if Trump is lying Walz said ?yes of
course.?
Walz and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris have taken a cautious and limited approach to media
appearances in recent weeks. But The Democratic candidates are ramping up their media schedule
in the closing weeks of the campaign.
Harris sat for an interview with the CBS program ?60 Minutes? and has other interviews scheduled
including with less traditional outlets like the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.
However Walz didn't specifically answer every question in his first appearance on a so-called
Sunday show. Asked if he supported Israel engaging in a preemptive strike against Iran nuclear or
oil facilities Walz was noncommittal saying: ?Specific operations will be dealt with at the time.?
The governor also was confronted about multiple instances where he has misrepresented aspects of
his life including his military service travel to China and fertility issues.
Asked whether people can trust him Walz said ?I will own up when I misspeak I will own up when I
make a mistake? and then trained his fire on Vance pointing out he refused to acknowledge at the
debate that Trump lost the 2020 election.
?I think they?re probably far more concerned with that? Walz said.",USA TODAY__I_will_own_up_when_I_misspeak__Walz_talks_misstat.pdf.pdf,news_articles

in pivotal battleground state
Andy Sullivan
Reuters
Voters in Georgia turned out in record numbers as the battleground state opened early voting for the
Nov. 5 presidential election between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump state
officials said on Tuesday.
At least 252000 voters had cast ballots at early-voting sites as of 4 p.m. EDT nearly double the
136000 who participated in the first day of early voting in the 2020 election said Gabriel Sterling
Georgia's No. 2 election official. ""Spectacular turnout"" he wrote on social media.
Early voting either in person or by mail has become increasingly popular with U.S. voters. Nearly 1
in 7 voters cast their ballots ahead of Election Day in 2020 according to the University of Florida's
Election Lab. However many Republicans opposed the dramatic expansion of mail voting that year
saying it was less secure than in-person voting and Trump cited false claims of mail ballot fraud as
he sought unsuccessfully to overturn his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.
Some Republicans continue to insist that voters should be able to cast their ballots only in person on
Election Day though party officials are encouraging supporters to vote ahead of time.
Nationwide 5.5 million Americans have already voted this year according to Election Lab. By
contrast 27 million people had cast their ballots at this point in the 2020 election as voters sought to
avoid crowded polling places during the COVID-19 pandemic.Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
Like some other states Georgia has tightened its mail-voting laws since then requiring voters who
want to cast an absentee ballot to provide proof of identity and limiting the number of places they
can deposit their ballots.

138,Liberal,USA TODAY,"'With your vote:' Donald Trump stumps in Michigan while turnout
machine looks for voters
WASHINGTON - As Republican White House nominee Donald Trump stumped Friday to Michigan
thousands of the former president's supporters are working behind the scenes on a project that will
likely decide the election: getting their people out to vote.
""By the way we win Michigan we win the whole thing ... like we did in 2016"" Trump said during a
jobs speech to close out the workweek in Walker Mich. ""But you gotta vote!""
In Trump's case his turnout operation is different from the one he rode to Electoral College victory in
2016. It's also the source of angst among some Republicans - for two big reasons.
One the Trump campaign is relying in large part on outside groups to walk neighborhoods knock
on doors and persuade people to vote. Two the Trump campaign is targeting people who often
don't cast ballots at all ""low propensity voters"" as opposed to ""swing voters"" who could make the
difference in a closely contested state.
""We will make more voter contacts in the 2024 election than we did in the 2020 election by the time
Election Day rolls around"" on Nov. 5 Trump political director James Blair recently said on ""The
Sean Spicer Show"" hosted by the former Trump White House press secretary.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
""We will have successfully canvassed more voters than we did four years ago"" Blair said.
Trump lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden including a popular vote margin of 81.3 millionto 74.2 million. Many Democrats credited their turnout operations including a heavy emphasis on
early voting and mail-in balloting - items that are also a Trump campaign priority in his current battle
with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.
During his jobs speech in Michigan which was largely a response to Harris' visit Friday to the
U.S.-Mexico border Trump attacked his opponent over migration economic policies and support
for electric cars. The ex-president also suggested that his support of tariffs is the reason that people
in foreign countries want to assassinate him.
Trump who had an evening event in the Detroit suburb of Warren ended his Walker speech by
urging supporters to participate in early voting if necessary: ""Thank you very much ... God bless you
... Go out and vote!""
Democrats said they are not worried about Trump's turnout operation questioning the expertise and
commitment of outside groups and the wisdom of focusing on low-propensity voters.
""The campaign side-idea of asking people to narrowly reach people in their universe theoretically
makes sense but I don't think they're actually implementing it at scale they would need to win""
Democratic operative Eddie Vale said.
As for using private groups to promote turnout Vale said ""outsourcing it to the outside groups never
works."" He noted that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tried it during his campaign for the 2024
Republican presidential nomination and ""it was literally an epic disaster.""
Some Republicans have grumbled about the Trump operation but have not gone public. Reuters
which polled Republican operatives nationwide reported that the focus on people who usually don'tvote is ""a high-risk labor-intensive strategy that could bring in a wave of new voters but could also
fall short if their targets ultimately stay home.""
Trump officials said their turnout operation is state of the art and will make the difference in the
seven key battleground states: Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin North Carolina Georgia
Arizona and Nevada.
It's easier - and cheaper - for campaigns to work with outside groups because of a Federal Election
Commission ruling that allows coordination of canvassing projects and the sharing of voter lists and
data.
The Trump team is working with political committees of groups that include Turning Point Action led
by millennial influencer Charlie Kirk; the Faith & Freedom Coalition headed by long-time Christian
conservative Ralph Reed; and America PAC backed by billionaire Trump endorser Elon Musk.
Michigan is one of those closely contested states that could be decided by which party has the best
turnout machine.
The Wolverine State helped Trump win the 2016 election but the Michigan Republican Party has
been in turmoil in more recent years Four years ago Trump lost to Biden in Michigan by fewer than
160000 votes.
Asked by Spicer about the use of outside groups in turnout Blair said: ""I feel more confident in some
groups than others shall we say ... But there are ways we can check on what they're doing.""
Political analysts said there's nothing particularly radical about what the Trump campaign is doing -and in any case it's impossible to assess how effective a turnout machine is until the votes are
counted in November.
""The results in the battleground states will depend on whether one campaign hired and deployed the
more competent field operation"" said James Gimpel a University of Maryland professor of
government who studies voter turnout.
Given the stakes he said it's not surprising that people would complain about these kinds of
operations.
""There is a lot of hand-wringing about the competence of field operations in every close election""
Gimpel said. ""Mobilization could definitely make the difference in battleground states. So of course
candidates parties and interested observers should be concerned.""
He added: ""In this very close contest both parties should be very concerned about their field
operations.""",USA TODAY__With_your_vote__Donald_Trump_stumps_in_Michigan_w.pdf.pdf,news_articles

473,Conservative,AskTrumpSupporters,"I think you should examine the transactions but it's nowhere near close to as important as Bidens. Trump handed his businesses off to his children when he became president. He wasn't in charge and had no business in his business. Trump lost money during his presidency, the only one ever. So I mean if you want to examine go ahead. It's good to look into dealing with our elected officials no matter the party. That's how you keep this country from being corrupt. The problem is it's all focused towards the Republicans and or Trump. Nobody cares to even examine anything the Democrats do. Biden's foreign payments are a lot different and more important. Trump has a business, that is designed to make money of course. What business does Biden have to even give any justifiable reason as to why he is accepting money? Biden is not even a businessman! If there is no justifiable evidence that would make sense of foreign money, that needs looking at 100%! Hunter has no credentials to work on the board of Burisma. In fact, he is a known crackhead! Bidens foreign money needs and deserves a lot more attention than it gets. It's clear corruption and it's cost lives, bro. It's not just money. There is no coincidence that Ukraine is in a war right now. If these allegations were taken more seriously sooner, Ukrainian and Russian lives wouldn't be dead. So no I do not agree that Trump's foreign money needs to be looked at as much as Biden's. Trump has an acceptable reason for it to begin with. Biden has no reason at all. Trump's foreign money hasn't cost people their lives and has not sold America out. Bidens has and it took away your own taxpayers money to aid Ukraine in a war that shouldn't have ever happened. This war would have never started if Bidens and other nato nations leaders stopped what they were doing and negotiated with Putin. Putin gave them a warning and all we had to do was talk it out. But we declined to do so. All Putin wanted was at least a neutral Ukraine. Ukraine not to join NATO. Ukraine wants to become part of NATO and paid Biden for it with bribes costing innocent people their lives and livelihoods. Trump's foreign money that was made by his kids is hardly as important nor impacted any of our lives compared to Biden's corruption! Biden's corruption has ended lives, created food shortages, taken away your taxpayer's money that could have been used for Lahaina, destroyed entire countries with war, created Ukrainian refugees, may bring us to WW3, made gas prices rise, the possibility of a Taiwan invasion from China, created the Wagner group, and pushed a lot of the world towards BRICS. An organization to get rid of the US dollar's power. If you think Trump's foreign money is the problem. You just hate Trump 100%. During his presidency, gas prices were low, no new wars, we were respected as nation, feared as a nation, unemployment was low, nothing to bring us to WW3, a good economy, a stronger military, etc. There is no implication that other governments paid to get their way at all. If they did hell they made America better? 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️ There was no selling out America during Trump's administration. Sure as hell was in Biden's. America has only got worse because of Biden. Bidens will result in treason which is punishable by death. Trumps is only enough to get into a court for it to be struck down as nothing like everything else thrown against him. It's time to wake up and quit making your political allegiance how you vote. Voting for Trump in today's time is something that should be seen as nonpartisan. Because Biden is 100% no good for America. He is a sellout and a traitor to our nation and there is no doubt about that.",Trumps Businesses Received At Least 78 Million,reddit

But then followed it with a bunch of stuff about his rallies. It should’ve been a quick pivot, like: “yes, please come to my rallies. See that everything she said is a lie. I invite you.” But then immediately” As far as the border bill, that was blocked for a reason. It did exactly opposite of what it said it was going to do.

He actually needs to learn from JD Vance because his answer to this question was absolutely impressive. As far as is it happening, according to residents (read all their testimonies on Twitter) yes. The eating a cat arrest is misinformation though. That doesn’t mean all of these residents’ testimonies should be placed ignored though.

1973,Conservative,Capitalism,Worker owned businesses are already here. Let’s check the stats and see if the workers make 10x what other workers make. No. Huh… There must be other costs and risks involved.,Communist Professor Makes Insane Argument Against,reddit
1974,Conservative,Capitalism,"The employer serves an important purpose that people like Richard Wolff miss: they sacrifice present goods in exchange for future goods. This is because they pay workers NOW to produce things that will be sold for money LATER. And because present goods are preferable to future goods, the market determines a rate of return that an employer will receive for making that sacrifice. Note that it is a reality of the world that someone must make this sacrifice, so employees are fortunate that employers make the sacrifice for them. Otherwise, employees would have to work now in exchange for money way in the future. For example, suppose there are construction workers building a house that the buyer will pay for at completion. If the house takes a year to build, the workers probably wouldn’t be too happy if they had to wait a year to get paid. So that’s where the employer enters the picture and pays the workers now, even though he won’t be paid for a year. That’s a valuable service to society that employers provide. Along with that naturally comes the risk involved in getting paid in the future. When someone owes you money, there is always the possibility that they will never pay you. Or, when you’re developing a new product, there is always the risk that people won’t like it and it will fail. Lucky for employees, they get to work on a product that may or may not be a success, but they get paid regardless. Therefore, the employer is providing a service to the employee, because the employee doesn’t have to worry about not being paid or about possibly even LOSING money.",Communist Professor Makes Insane Argument Against,reddit
1975,Conservative,Capitalism,"Now, what if you don’t value employers, and you’d rather not be involved in them? That’s when you simply become self employed. But the objection to this is always something like “but I don’t have money to start a business”. EXACTLY. The employer is offering you an arrangement where you can get paid without making an initial investment. That’s exactly why employers are making a useful contribution. If you want to argue that this isn’t a useful contribution, then why would you work for someone else? You can’t just say “employers are totally exploitative and bring nothing to the table” and then turn around and fill out a job application.

6635,Liberal,AskALiberal,"The $25k sounds like the least useful of these but we don’t know the exact eligibility requirements yet/how much funding specifically will be available for this. I can see the logic that the $25k will help these buyers be more competitive in the marketplace vs real estate investors but ofc this seems like it would drive up demand/cost a little bit, not by “25k instantly” like some of the right wingers already commenting on the askaliberal subreddit are claiming ofc..",Harris Has Proposed 25K For Down Payment,reddit

6639,Liberal,AskALiberal,I'm not sure if this concept or policy is thought through. I don't necessarily think that home values will change because of this.

6643,Liberal,AskALiberal,I got a FHA loan which didn't require 20% I used 3.5%.

6645,Liberal,AskALiberal,"The issue is right now specifically with interest rates rates being high AND homes being expensive getting into the housing market is insurmountable.

6647,Liberal,AskALiberal,"Maryland had a program where first time buyers could get $25K essentially as an interest free loan, and then a conventional 30 year loan for the rest of the value. You just had to pay the $25K back when you sold. Prices didn’t jump up, it just helped people moving to Maryland or buying their first homes. It unfortunately ran out a couple of months before I closed on my first apartment, otherwise it would’ve been really nice. I probably would’ve been locked out of buying if I didn’t have some family support to help me cover the down payment after that program expired.

6648,Liberal,AskALiberal,"The down payment is a big hurdle for a lot of people, so I think this opens doors for them. And since it’s just first time buyers and is being paired with other plans to help on the supply side, I think the concerns of housing prices shooting up are unfounded.
