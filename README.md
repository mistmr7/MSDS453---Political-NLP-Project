"# MSDS453---Political-NLP-Project" 



Problem Question/Statement: How accurately can machine learning models classify political bias in news articles and social media communities using language patterns and content from Reddit and major news outlets?

We are planning to designate conservative and liberal news articles and channels using posts from subreddits identified as either right-leaning/conservative and left-leaning/liberal. Using that data we can gauge different news articles from similar dates to see if the program can adequately consolidate different news articles into either bucket classified as liberal or conservative news. The model will take language used within news articles to identify similarities in language across reddit posts that are upvoted and consistently used within subreddit groups. Including a probability scale, we can identify the scope of news articles and what direction they lean on the political spectrum. We have two proposed methodologies to complete this project as seen below.


Methodology 1: 


Develop a machine learning model to classify political messaging into left, center, and right-leaning categories based on content extracted from social media communities such as Reddit. The model will then be used to test and evaluate political bias in media articles from major news outlets.


Methodology 2: 


Develop a machine learning model to classify political messaging into left, center, and right-leaning categories based on content extracted from media articles from major news outlets. The model will then be used to test and evaluate social media communities such as Reddit.
